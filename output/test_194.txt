Wilson s information was provided to the legal team that filed whistleblower lawsuits against BNY Mellon in 2009 and then aided state attorneys general in subsequent probes. The legal team includes Boston lawyer Michael Lesser and Philip Michael a lawyer in New York as well as Harry Markopolos a fraud investigator best known for warning that Bernard Madoff was operating a fraudulent scheme One employee having learned that probes were looking at how BNY Mellon traded currencies said It s over it s all over according to a March 2010 document.

Another document describes two months later how a senior banker addressed FX traders and told them the bank had received 16 subpoenas. This employee told the traders We have not done anything wrong. In a seven page memo Wilson and his legal team provided detailed biographies of fellow traders and employees at BNY Mellon to help determine whether they might be helpful in the whistleblower legal effort One memo was written by Wilson s lawyers in August 2010 some eight months before Wilson left the bank.

In the memo Wilson s lawyers tell the Florida attorney general that Wilson knows that efforts to obtain documents from the bank are being stymied with claims of difficulty in production or other delays. The memo using Wilson s knowledge of the bank states that the information actually could be easily obtained because it is centrally stored. It is stored at a state of the art facility that should hasten rather than hinder any document response from the bank. A month later in September 2010 Wilson s lawyers submitted another memo to Florida s attorney general noting We would also like to remind you that Wilson continues in his employment at the bank Specific information documents and conversations mentioned here could be connected to Wilson. That memo alleges that BNY Mellon is now actively and hurriedly formulating a strategy aimed at preserving profits from the foreign exchange business at the center of the state inquiries. The memo explains that BNY Mellon publicly wants to provide a supposedly more transparent foreign exchange system One employee was described as worried about job security Not financially secure.

Scared and probably loyal to the Bank. But also would not be inclined to perjure herself She has a lot of information. Another senior executive likes to rant and rave Mr Wilson assumes he will want to defend the bank. A sales executive seems willing to push the envelope when it comes to producing profits.
