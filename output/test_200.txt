In an age when everyone can play games on smartphones and iPads there is no way to boost profits without producing software.

The results are very bad. It s not just Sony but Japanese IT firms have similar problems. They are failing to innovate and produce industry leading products in almost every major area from TVs to displays tablets and smartphones. Sony needs to ditch unprofitable businesses including TVs improve product line ups and unveil more appealing mobile devices.

Its hardware business is doing poorly. Samsung TVs sell at higher price and now they have to compete with Apple TV. In short it has failed to change.

MAKOTO KIKUCHI CEO MYOJO ASSET MANAGEMENT TOKYO I don t know what Hirai san is like but he can t take a strategy of expansion. It s going to be one of restructuring and merging. It s going to be downsizing. Investors don t know what the final cost of restructuring is going to be how much loss it s going to cause so even though it is trading below book its stock doesn t appeal. On the future of Sony Panasonic and Sharp I don t think they are going to go out of business and I wouldn t go as far to say they are going to end up as zombie firm but they face a future of no growth. WONG KOK HOI CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT APS ASSET MANAGEMENT SINGAPORE Most of the Japanese electronics companies have been hit by the strong yen.
