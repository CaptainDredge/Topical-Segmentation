It fits with the most recent batch of economic data that suggests a slowdown. But in a broader context we are still doing better than other major economies. It still remains to be seen if we re facing more Fed easing. MICHELLE MEYER SENIOR ECONOMIST BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH NEW YORK To me the disappointing part of the report is in the employment component If you read through the commentary by the respondents it does not reflect the data however and I am surprised that the respondents were not more pessimistic.

The respondents comments are not a reflection of the economic backdrop we have today. Overall the data held up but is still at a low level and I do not think this counters the significantly weak data we have been seeing. OMER ESINER CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE WASHINGTON The headline is a little better than expected but when we look at subcomponents of the report most notably employment there s more disappointment Even if it was in line with expectations there s a sigh of relief from many that it wasn t worse. Europe s obviously a concern but we ve been selling off for weeks on that. A slightly better than expected services number which makes the majority of the U S economy is a sigh of relief in the face of a lot of bearishness.

TOM PORCELLI CHIEF ECONOMIST RBC CAPITAL MARKETS NEW YORK It is interesting that services held up as well as it did NEW YORK Reuters The pace of growth in the vast services sector picked up a tad in May as a gauge of new orders improved according to an industry report released on Tuesday COMMENTS PETER BOOCKVAR EQUITY STRATEGIST MILLER TABAK CO NEW YORK The equities market is very fearful of the economic data This further supports the idea of slowing job growth.

This adds ammunition to last Friday s disappointing payroll number. Next month we could see modest improvement in payrolls because we were still seeing some payback for the weather related gains from earlier this year. For the rest of year we won t see payroll contraction but it will be in the order of sub 100 000 gains a month.

If economic conditions worsen and people perceive it s difficult find a job we could see a further drop in the participation rate which could cap a rise in the jobless rate. The expansion in the services sector like the manufacturing sector has been modest with the overall recovery.
