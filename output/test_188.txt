Being a little more cautious ahead of a downgrade is instructive given what is happening in Europe. There is little prospect of a miraculous plan to come up with a way to reduce the deficit that would unite Democrats and Republicans and so this announcement makes sense. WARD MCCARTHY CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST MANAGING DIRECTOR FIXED INCOME DIVISION JEFFERIES CO NEW YORK It confirms what is generally expected and nothing is imminent Putting it on a negative credit watch that seems to be in concert with the other two ratings agencies so I don t think we re going to see much of a market reaction.

It s generally confirmation of what s been built into the market. RAYMOND REMY TREASURIES TRADER DAIWA SECURITIES NEW YORK I think it s probably old news because the other ones did it first The downgrade itself won t come until 2013 per the report and this has been well known as a risk since the Congressional super committee failure.

The market is more focused on Europe the Fed buying the long end and risk aversion heading into month and year end. MARK VITNER SENIOR ECONOMIST WELLS FARGO CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA This does not surprise me at all as not a great deal has been done to improve the long term prospects for bringing down the deficit Eventually the debt is going to have to be dealt with but the fundamental strength of the economy is still fine.

The markets already assumed this was going to happen. It would be different if it was a downgrade but a negative outlook is not the end of the world. FRED DICKSON CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST THE DAVIDSON COS LAKE OSWEGO OREGON The affirmation of the AAA is fine The biggest risk for another downgrade would be Congress undoing the sequester in 2011.

Congress has a time honored tradition of undoing budget fetters but it is too early to get a handle on the strength of the undo the sequester movement at the current juncture. JIM CARON HEAD OF INTEREST RATE STRATEGY MORGAN STANLEY NEW YORK I don t think a downgraded outlook has much of an impact right now
