WASHINGTON Reuters The following comments were made on Thursday at a House Agriculture Committee hearing to examine the bankruptcy of MF Global. It was the first hearing to bring the major players together since the firm s collapse The star witness was Jon Corzine former chief executive of the MF Global Inc TERRENCE DUFFY EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN CME GROUP INC ON LOST FUNDS While it is clear that action is necessary to restore customer confidence and protect against future failures the fact is that MFG broke rules by moving customer segregated funds out of an account over which it had control.

Our audit and spot check of MFG were performed at the highest professional level the transfer of segregated funds out of the appropriate accounts was disguised from all regulators. While it is clear that action is necessary to restore customer confidence and protect against future failures the fact is that MFG broke rules by moving customer segregated funds out of an account over which it had control. JAMES KOBAK ON CUSTOMER RECORDS Most of the mess we see is really from the last week or two and again I am not an accountant we have Deloitte and others working for us I think frankly the customer Do we blame the police officer the day after our house gets broken into.

Of course not. EXCHANGE WITH REP DENNIS CARDOZA D CA Cardoza pressed Corzine on what his first reaction was upon learning about the missing money. Did you call the police. Did you run to the bathroom and throw up. he asked In fact MF Global reduced leverage. As the chief executive officer of MF Global I ultimately had overall responsibility for the firm. 
========
I did not however generally involve myself in the mechanics of the clearing and settlement of trades or in the movement of cash and collateral. At the time that MF Global entered into the transactions I believed that its investments in short term European debt securities were prudent. I haven t reviewed records to be absolutely precise in whether there was some small entry at some point but I don t remember as I sit here and as I said to the chairman I feel comfortable there was no intention certainly on my part to violate any segregation rules. CORZINE ON POSSIBLE THREATS TO THE BOARD I did not threaten the board that I would leave I had one specific conversation with the lead director which could have been interpreted that way. 
========
If the board used the powers it held had lost confidence in me I would be willing to step down. CORZINE ON LOST FUNDS AND REPAYING CUSTOMERS Moreover there were an extraordinary number of transactions during MF Global s last few days and I do not know for example whether there were operational errors at MF Global or elsewhere or whether banks and counterparties have held onto funds that should rightfully have been returned to MF Global. That is a question I would like to know the answer to as much as you and I am hopeful that there will be effective recovery and reconciliation of these accounts
