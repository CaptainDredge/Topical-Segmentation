We try not to overpromote paid services. We are developing new services which will be advertisement paid Zennstrom said at a media event in Estonia where most of development work for the service has been done SkypeOut allows them to call to phones from their Skype account.

The takeover of the rapidly growing European start up with little financial track record was justified by eBay as holding out the promise of rapid growth from customers making overseas calls and by using Skype to connect buyers and sellers on eBay s core auction business Zennstrom pointed to advertising revenue opportunities from already opened SkypeFind which has more than 200 000 yellow page listings across the world and mentioned videosharing as another such business Skype could enter. We still think that SkypeIn and SkypeOut will be bulk of our revenues in the near term future Zennstrom said.
