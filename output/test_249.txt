Looking out over the crowded room Squires predicted the case would be a mega Chapter 11. During the hearing Christian Kemnitz an attorney representing Discus Master Limited an investment partnership based in the British Virgin Islands and one of Sentinel s biggest clients accused the company of disturbing and illegal behavior. There s more going on here than simple mismanagement Kemnitz said CHICAGO Reuters The U S Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges on Monday against Sentinel Management Group Inc the cash management firm serving the U S futures industry that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late on Friday In a complaint filed in U S District Court in Chicago the SEC accused Sentinel of defrauding clients by improperly commingling misappropriating and leveraging their securities without their knowledge in violation of the Investment Advisers Act That review found that Sentinel failed to maintain adequate books and records including records to demonstrate the location of some accounts and whether or not the accounts assets were in any way encumbered the NFA document said. 
========
As a result the NFA issued an order prohibiting Sentinel from liquidating selling transferring encumbering or otherwise disposing of any securities. That order came one day after the company which managed about 1 6 billion of assets had already frozen client accounts a move that helped roil global financial markets last week According to the complaint the SEC alleged that Sentinel transferred at least 460 million in securities from client investment accounts to Sentinel s proprietary house account.

Sentinel also used securities from client accounts as collateral to obtain a 321 million line of credit as well as additional leveraged financing the SEC alleged In the letter it sent to clients informing them of the freeze Sentinel blamed the redemption suspension on the liquidity crisis in the market.

Investor fear has overtaken reason and has induced a period in which most securities have simply ceased to trade it said. But in the complaint filed on Monday the SEC said Sentinel s explanation was false and misleading. For months it said clients had suffered undisclosed losses and risks of losses due to Sentinel s undisclosed use of leverage and commingling and misappropriation of clients securities.

The SEC said that on the day Sentinel froze accounts the statements it was providing clients listed hundreds of millions of dollars in securities that were not held by Sentinel at all were held by Sentinel and treated as its own assets or were pledged as collateral for loans extended to Sentinel. News about Sentinel came on the heels of problems at funds managed by Bear Stearns Cos Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other companies in the United States and abroad
