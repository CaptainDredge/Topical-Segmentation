CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Saturday that China was providing his nation with a long-term, $20 billion financing plan for major projects in the South American oil-exporter."China is going to give financing to Venezuela, to the Venezuelan people, to the Bolivarian Revolution ... over the long-term and in large volume of some $20 billion," Chavez said at a signing ceremony in Caracas.Multinationals often structure intercompany capital transfers as debt so they can deduct the interest. The IRS is challenging such claims more frequently, tax lawyers said, despite two court losses it suffered last year. "I have seen the IRS go after these structures very aggressively ... The IRS believes this is really low-hanging fruit," said Elan Keller, a tax lawyer with Caplin & Drysdale.But Beijing's approval process would be "gradual", he added. Foreigners can invest in Chinese securities under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme, but a $10 billion ceiling for combined investment under the scheme was reached in February. Foreign banks such as UBS ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) have already said they want bigger QFII quotas.TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso welcomed a statement released by the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday saying that the group recognizes Japan's policy steps are not aimed at affecting foreign exchange markets."It was meaningful for us as (the G7) properly recognizes that steps we are taking to beat deflation are not aimed at influencing currency markets," Aso told reporters.NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Macy's Inc ( M.N ) said on Friday that it signed a deal with Tommy Hilfiger USA Inc for Macy's to be the exclusive department store retailer of Tommy Hilfiger men's and women's sportswear in the United States.The deal begins in fall 2008, Macy's said.
