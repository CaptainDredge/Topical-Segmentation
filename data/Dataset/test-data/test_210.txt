We are far short of maximum unemployment. And I expect inflation to fall this year below the 2 percent level that we view as consistent with our mandate. Let me emphasize, though, that overall things are turning for the better. You can sense greater optimism in the business community, although it is cautious optimism." * ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, March 1 "Given the circumstances of the economy, which I described earlier as still striving to get its legs, I continue to think the benefits of low-rate policy outweigh the risks." * FED GOVERNOR SARAH BLOOM RASKIN, March 1 "(T)he headwinds that have been restraining the expansion for some time have been easing, at best, only gradually ...The decline in the unemployment rate over the past year has been somewhat more rapid than might have been expected, given that the economy appears to have been growing during that time frame at or below its longer-term trend." * FED GOVERNOR ELIZABETH DUKE, February 27 "The failure of the housing market to respond to lower interest rates as vigorously as it has in the past indicates that factors other than financial conditions may be restraining improvements in mortgage credit and housing market conditions."
