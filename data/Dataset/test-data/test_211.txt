"Our plan is the only one on the AMR property that includes the option of a lump sum and our experts have concluded that attempting to preserve a lump-sum option is not achievable," APA President David Bates said. VICTORY FOR PENSION INSURER AMR said in February that it would seek bankruptcy court approval to terminate traditional pension plans covering 130,000 workers and retirees.AMR still wants to terminate the pilots' plan unless it can get the lump sum matter resolved. The Allied Pilots Association said in a letter to members that it would ask them to waive the lump sum option in the plans that feature it so that those pensions can be frozen as well.Those plans would be replaced with 401(k) plans with a company match. Employer-financed defined benefit plans provide a fixed payout over time and are historically more generous than the 401(k) or other cash plans that mix employee and employer contributions that are more common today. Traditional pensions are often still found in heavily unionized industries such as airlines, autos and aerospace.AMR's pensions covering pilots, flight attendants and ground workers were underfunded by an estimated $10 billion when the company filed for bankruptcy. Underfunding is the difference between the assets in a plan and the amount of future obligations. United Airlines had the largest pension default in the United States at nearly $9 billion underfunded.The company has been leaning on its labor unions to agree to concessions. Should AMR and its unions be unable to reach consensual deals, AMR could ask the bankruptcy judge to abrogate existing labor deals and allow the company to impose new terms.
