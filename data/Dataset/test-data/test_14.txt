NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ), the sixth-largest U.S. bank, said on Tuesday fourth-quarter profit fell 21 percent, hurt by losses from loans and money market mutual funds, and a legal settlement.Net income was $942 million, or 53 cents per share, down from $1.19 billion, or 66 cents, a year earlier.That figure is more than twice the size of the bailout, which had been repeatedly delayed amid concerns from other EU states that the close business and banking ties with Russia made Cyprus a conduit for money-laundering. It ranks as the largest source of foreign direct investment into Russia - money that is largely Russian in origin."The Madoff connection is sad," the Journal quoted Tully as saying. He said he invested with Steffens because "you back people you know and trust." Komansky could not be reached to comment, the paper said.

Revenue rose to $30.4 billion. Analysts had expected $30.5 billion. The quarterly results come as the company, the largest U.S. health insurer and the first to report earnings for the period, prepares for more changes stemming from President Barack Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act."There is no way to extract the underlying trend in claims from the numbers; we'll need to wait another couple of weeks before the distortions fade sufficiently to have any confidence that the claims numbers are telling us anything about the true state of the labor market," he said.
