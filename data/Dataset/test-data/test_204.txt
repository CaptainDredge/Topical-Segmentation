While the EU's own Eurostat statistical agency has since said the deficit was calculated in accordance with its standards, the affair has become a political hot potato between the two parties in Greece's ruling coalition. "Now is the time to clarify things," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told the assembly before his Socialist PASOK party used its majority to launch the investigation with a late-night 168-76 vote in favor.ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's parliament voted on Thursday for an inquiry into claims the previous Socialist government inflated 2009 public deficit figures, a step that could put the reliability of the country's data back in the spotlight just days after it won a new bailout.The upwards revision of Greece's budget deficit in 2009 to 15.4 percent of gross domestic product exposed to its euro zone partners the scale of its fiscal derailment and fuelled the debt crisis, raising fears over the fate of the euro currency union.Surveys show PASOK and New Democracy have both lost voters thanks to the tough budget cuts agreed in return for the EU/IMF bailout. But New Democracy is hopeful it can end up the leading party after an April election and so occupy the prime minister post currently held by the technocrat Lucas Papademos.While Tuesday's agreement in Brussels on a 130 billion euro rescue package averts for now the threat of a chaotic default, it came only after the 17-nation euro zone sought unprecedented surveillance measures over Greece's budget practices. In September, a board member of Greece's ELSTAT statistics body accused its chief Andreas Georgiou of inflating the public deficit data under pressure from the then Socialist government, which was seeking to justify harsh new austerity measures.Calls for an inquiry made headlines last year and PASOK might otherwise face an investigation later when it might not have a majority. "There is no logic to the New Democracy stance," PASOK deputy Theodora Tzakri told Reuters. "They voted for the bailout and now they are not voting for the investigating committee." The parliamentary inquiry is due to start in coming days and be concluded by the end of March.
