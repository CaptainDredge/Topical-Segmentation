REYKJAVIK  (Reuters) - Iceland's parliament approved on Wednesday an amended bill to repay more than $5 billion lost by savers in Britain and the Netherlands when the island's banks collapsed.The passage of the legislation boosts the country's chances of swift entry to the European Union and of getting its shattered economy back on track.The judicial sources said Proto's past statements about his offers for stakes in Italian banks Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ) and UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), publisher RCS ( RCSM.MI ) and car maker Fiat ( FIA.MI ), were only partially true. Prosecutors believe that Proto announced these offers without making clear that they had been immediately rejected, the sources said.CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following are the 20 top-selling vehicles in the U.S. through September of 2008 as reported by the automakers.Total sales of the top 20 vehicles fell 7.7 percent or -341,905 units to 4,107,743.

Chrysler is using the bankruptcy process to move faster toward that goal, while GM plans to tell its dealerships they are being dropped for not meeting standards for capitalization and profitability. GM wants to cut its dealer network to 3,605 from over 6,246 at the end of 2008.
