By 2015, flat panel industry research company DisplaySearch expects annual global sales of liquid crystal TVs to contract by 8 percent to $92 billion. Even worse, plasma sets, a market that Panasonic dominates, will shrink 38 percent to $7 billion. Exiting TVs is not really an option, said Shiro Mikoshiba, analyst at Nomura Holdings.There, consumer business chief Kazuo Hirai will take over from CEO Howard Stringer on April 1. Together, Sony, Panasonic and Sharp expect to lose $17 billion this year alone, highlighting the savaging of Japan's electronics industry by foreign rivals led by Samsung Electronics, weak demand and a strong yen. "Panasonic has to change.SPRAWLING Tsuga takes over a sprawling conglomerate whose products range from refrigerators, fax machines and TVs to light bulbs, bicycle pumps and hair dryers. Even after Ohtsubo's latest restructuring axes 17,000 jobs, Panasonic still employs some 350,000 workers worldwide, three times as many as at Samsung, double Sony's workforce, and 60,000 more than General Electric, where annual sales are $30 billion higher.If Japanese electronics makers are going to be able to compete globally their slow management style isn't going to cut it," said Tetsuro Ii, CEO of Commons Asset Management in Tokyo, adding Tsuga "had to be clear about whether the company was going to stick with TVs or give up on them." At a news conference in Osaka, western Japan, Tsuga vowed to focus on bolstering profitability in the TV business.Founded as a maker of plugs almost a century ago, Panasonic has warned it will make a loss of 780 billion yen ($9.7 billion) in the year to end-March, as it counts the cost of restructuring its business, particularly in TVs. It will also write down 250 billion yen from its acquisition of rival Sanyo Electric.
