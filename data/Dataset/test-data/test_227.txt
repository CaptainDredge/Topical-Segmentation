The blocks have estimated resources of 3.3 billion metric tonnes (3.63 billion tons) of crude oil and gas condensate and up to 2.8 trillion cubic meters of gas. Eni was expected to develop the Val Shatskogo area of the Black Sea that had been given up by Chevron. (Additional reporting by  Stephen Jewkes  in Milan, Writing by Douglas Busvine; editing by  Elizabeth Piper )The deal would be modeled on the Exxon-Rosneft pact, with Eni taking a minority stake of 30 percent in the exploration venture and shouldering up-front investment costs, two industry sources told Reuters. "The deal will be similar to that between Rosneft and Exxon," one of the sources said. A third source said the deal would be "strategically massive" for state-controlled Eni.Exxon and Shell ( RDSa.L ) have offshore projects near the Pacific island of Sakhalin that were set up in the 1990s as production-sharing agreements - a structure now spurned by the Kremlin due to cost overruns that hit state revenues. Industry and political sources say the return of Putin to the Kremlin on March 4 has opened the way for the latest deals.Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, a Putin ally of roughly two decades, has been behind a push to fix the tax regime and secure key deals before Putin's return, which may trigger the loss of his formal brief as Russia's top energy official. A QUESTION OF TIMING Full scale production in the Arctic is likely to be years - if not decades - away due to the huge technical and logistical challenges of producing oil in the ice-strewn waters.Both Rosneft and Eni declined to comment. As with the Exxon deal, Rosneft would gain access to Eni projects outside Russia - part of a Kremlin strategy to expand the country's oil industry abroad and gain know-how to apply to projects at home. The prize for reserve-hungry foreign majors is Russia's vast but largely unexplored offshore riches, which the world's top oil producer must exploit to sustain output above 10 million barrels per day.
