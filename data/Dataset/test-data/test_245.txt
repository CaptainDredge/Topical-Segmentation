GM's chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew, said on a conference call that the automaker expects to see sales outside the United States rise by 400,000 to 500,000 units this year. GM, which has been struggling in the United States -- its largest and historically most profitable market -- has been growing overseas as it loses market share to Japanese competitors at home."We anticipate (the U.S.) will still be the most profitable market in the decade ahead," Ballew said on the call. "It's really key not to be excessively dependent on the U.S., but you still need to be successful in the U.S." Ballew said GM should begin seeing a recovery in U.S. in 2008.For the first six months, sales rose 1.7 percent to 4.674 million units. First-half sales were just 42,000 units short of Toyota's tally of 4.716 million units for the first half, down from a difference of 90,000 units in the first quarter. Toyota's January-June sales were up 8 percent from the year before, a Toyota spokeswoman said.GM on Wednesday said it would invest $500 million in Brazil and Argentina to develop smaller vehicles for Latin America and other emerging markets. In the Asia/Pacific region, GM sales rose 8 percent, driven by big gains in China. GM said it is on track to become the first automaker to exceed annual sales of 1 million vehicles in China.DETROIT/TOKYO  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. narrowed the gap with top seller Toyota Motor Corp. in the first half of 2007 thanks to a solid second quarter, although demand continued to fall in its home North American market.Detroit-based GM said on Thursday its global sales in April-June totaled 2.4 million vehicles, up less than 10,000 vehicles from a year earlier.
