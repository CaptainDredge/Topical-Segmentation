The lawsuit is based on a story that appeared last month in the New York Times that reported Wal-Mart de Mexico, which is 69 percent owned by Wal-Mart, orchestrated a widespread bribery campaign to win market dominance. The article alleged senior Wal-Mart executives knew about the matter and tried to cover it up."We need truly independent directors who will set the right tone from the top." The pension fund has retained the law firms of Girard Gibbs Llp and Labaton Sucharow Llp for the lawsuit, which was filed in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware. Defendants named in the lawsuit include Michael Duke, Wal-Mart's chief executive and a board member, H.Legal and retail experts also raised concerns about Duke and Scott, who were among senior executives allegedly aware of the situation, according to the New York Times. CalSTR's lawsuit contends an internal probe by Wal-Mart found evidence as far back as late 2005 that Walmex had violated Mexican and U.S. laws, but then-CEO Scott blasted the investigating team for being "overly aggressive".The company's shares, which lost almost 4 percent in April, closed at around $59 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. If the allegations are true, Wal-Mart may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which forbids bribes to foreign government officials, and run afoul of Sarbanes-Oxley rules that require corporate gatekeepers to report material violations of securities laws."We are reviewing the lawsuit closely and are thoroughly investigating the issues that have been raised." Wal-Mart Stores is under investigation over accusations its Mexican subsidiary bribed local officials for years to build its business there. The world's largest retailer has shed billions of dollars in market value since the allegations first surfaced last month, prompting the official inquiry as well as several lawsuits back home.
