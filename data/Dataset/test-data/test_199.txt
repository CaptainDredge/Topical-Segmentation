Textron Inc's ( TXT.N ) results easily topped analysts' estimates, and the company forecast 11 percent revenue growth for 2012, driven by strength at its Cessna corporate jet and Bell helicopter units. Shares of Textron surged as much as 16 percent to their highest level since July. United Tech said slowing Chinese elevator orders and a sharper-than-expected decline in demand in North America for air conditioning equipment had caused revenue to grow just 0.6 percent to $14.97 billion, $100 million short of forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."2012 is going to be a tough year." Over the past week, Germany's Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) posted a sharper-than-expected drop in operating profit, and General Electric Co ( GE.N ) reported a steeper revenue decline than Wall Street had anticipated. United Tech, the world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners, reiterated the 2012 profit target it had issued in December, which calls for growth of 6 percent to 9 percent excluding the costs of its largest-ever acquisition, a $16.5 billion pending takeover of aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N. Rockwell, a maker of factory automation systems whose fiscal year ends in September, reiterated its forecast of 5 percent to 13 percent profit growth this year.(Reuters) - Three major manufacturers reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings as cost cuts offset somewhat lackluster revenue, and they stuck to their forecasts for this year despite slowing growth in China, which until recently had been a bright spot for the economy.Revenue at both United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) and Rockwell Automation Inc ( ROK.N ) slightly missed Wall Street forecasts, a sign of deteriorating demand for their products."Overall, it was a very slow-growth fourth quarter," Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said in an interview. Likewise, Rockwell Automation recorded flat sales in Asia, factoring out exchange-rate fluctuations, as a tightening of credit in China caused Chinese-owned companies to scale back their spending on factory management systems. Rockwell's total sales rose 7.9 percent to $1.47 billion, below the $1.51 billion analysts had forecast.Textron shares were up 15.5 percent at $24.95 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
