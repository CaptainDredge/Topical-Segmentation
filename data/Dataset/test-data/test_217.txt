(Reuters) - Every time Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) President Gary Cohn sticks his chin out, he seems to take another hit.The 51-year-old banker, widely seen as the natural successor to Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, once again finds himself caught up in another public relations fiasco involving the storied Wall Street investment bank.The two executives oversaw a similar conflict in 2010 related to buying and selling shares of pre-IPO tech darling Facebook in private transactions. A unit in Goldman's investment management division passed on buying Facebook shares, saying the price was too rich, though the bank bought a $450 million stake itself with plans to sell another $1.5 billion worth of shares to wealthy clients.After the transactions drew scrutiny, Goldman limited investments to its foreign clients. May be the most serious public lashing Goldman got came from in 2010 when the firm was accused by U.S. securities regulators and a Senate subcommittee of selling faulty subprime-mortgage linked securities to investors. Goldman paid a $500 million fine to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission over its marketing of collateralized debt obligations.That's in part because both Blankfein and Cohn come from the trading side of the Wall Street firm and are seen as standing arm-in-arm on big decisions for the past six years. Indeed, on Wednesday there was little separation between the two men. In a letter to the firm's employees, in which they took issue with Smith's assertions, they said Goldman is committed to "the work it does on behalf of our clients." William Cohan, a former investment banker and author of "Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World," said it appears Goldman's board remains in Blankfein's and Cohn's camp and sees public attacks like Smith's as misguided and irrelevant distractions.But he said you could say the same thing about any other big Wall Street investment firm. This customer, who didn't want to be named, said Wall Street firms like Goldman long ago stopped being client centric after they went from private partnerships to publicly traded companies, which forces executives to focus ever more on the bottom line.
