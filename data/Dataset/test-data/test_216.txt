NEW LANDSCAPE FOR OTC DRUGS Read said Pfizer hoped to introduce a non-prescription form of Lipitor, but this would not happen in the short term. Pfizer is discussing the issue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is seeking public comment on the idea of making more medicines available OTC."It's the largest animal health business and it would stand alone as an individual company. There's huge interest among investors to own a company like that," Read said. "With nutritional there are lots of companies that are already in the nutritional business and have it as a major development area." Speculation about a possible sale of animal health, which analysts believe could be worth $15-20 billion, was fuelled last week by reports that Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) had made an approach that was rebuffed by Pfizer, while Bayer AG ( BAYGn.DE ) was also weighing a move.But he did not see a need for another large-scale deal such as the $67 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. Asked about the possibility of buying out Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ), its partner on promising anti-clotting drug Eliquis, Read said: "I'm not sure that would create shareholder value."We would like to sell it over the counter. We're in discussions and development with the FDA on that," Read said, adding a recent change to remove the need for liver monitoring was positive for the drug class. Back in 2008, the FDA rejected a bid to sell Mevacor, another cholesterol drug from Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ), without prescription."I would probably handicap animal health as more likely to be a spin than a sale," the CEO of the world's biggest drugmaker said in an interview in London. Read, who took over as Pfizer chief in December 2010 at a challenging time, is shrinking the group by divesting non-core businesses, including veterinary medicine and infant nutrition.
