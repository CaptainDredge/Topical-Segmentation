But the poll showed the labor market will add only an average of about 170,000 jobs each month this quarter and remain below 200,000 through to the end of next year. By some measures, that is barely enough to keep up with population growth. Jobless claims data on Thursday suggested the labor market is still struggling and that a spurt of hiring in recent months may be petering out.A swathe of better-than-expected data in the first months of the year pushed growth estimates for the first quarter up to an annualized rate of 2.2 percent from the 1.9 percent expected in March's poll. Indeed, of 63 common contributors between both surveys, 41 upgraded their growth estimates for the first quarter.Economists held their inflation expectation to an average 2.3 percent for the second quarter, in line with last month. Core inflation is seen more subdued at 2.1 percent. Still, the recovery is fragile, with a number of potential hurdles to contend with. The struggling housing sector remains a thorn in the economy's side and although there are signs housing is starting to stabilize, any meaningful recovery in prices is not expected until next year.Part of what has lifted optimism on growth has been the resiliency of the consumer, even faced with rising gasoline and oil prices, said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. "Spending has been holding up reasonably well despite these higher gas prices, which we knew was going to weigh on consumer spending like it has the past few years," said Bullard.NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A slowly improving jobs market and reasonably solid growth at the start of the year have brightened the economic outlook for 2012, reducing chances the Federal Reserve will conduct another round of bond purchases, a Reuters poll found.Economists in the poll, taken in the past week, also raised their inflation expectations, though core consumer prices, which excludes volatile food and gasoline, are seen rising in line with the Fed's target of 2 percent.
