"Meanwhile, the further marked rise in euro zone unemployment in April maintains belief that consumer spending will be generally muted in the near term at least, especially as consumers are also facing muted wage growth and tighter fiscal policy in many countries."

Indeed, the Spanish unemployment rate hit a dismal 24.3 percent. Greek unemployment is also rising sharply although there was no data for April. "With the euro zone seemingly headed for renewed clear GDP contraction in the second quarter - and with overall Eurozone business confidence taking a further serious hit in May to be at the weakest level for two years or more across sectors - the likelihood is that the euro zone unemployment rate will move significantly higher."Indeed, it now looks odds-on that the euro zone unemployment rate will reach 11.5 percent by the end of the year, although the situation will vary markedly between countries. "Companies generally are under serious pressure to keep their labor forces as tight as possible to contain their costs in the face of current limited demand, strong competition, squeezed margins and worrying and uncertain growth outlooks.The number of jobless in the 17-country region rose by 110,000 in April, marking the 12th straight monthly increase. "The lack of change in the overall euro zone unemployment rate reflected increasing disparities between countries, with the jobless rate in Germany falling to 5.4 percent and unemployment in Spain and Portugal increasing further from already intolerably high levels.It was hardly any comfort that this was down from a rise of 133,000 in March and was the smallest increase since December.
