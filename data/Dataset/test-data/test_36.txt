Nasdaq Stock Market parent Nasdaq OMX and BATS Exchange, the other players in the country's cut-throat trading industry, recently applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer similar products. Direct Edge, the No. 3 U.S. equities-trading venue, has made big market share gains in recent months. Big Board parent NYSE Euronext, which retains the biggest market share, last week urged the SEC to reject the Nasdaq and BATS filings on the grounds it "impedes a free and open market system and harms the investing public." NYSE Euronext's May 28 letter also highlighted Direct Edge's product, called the Enhanced Liquidity Provider (ELP), asking the market regulator to "undertake a market-wide review of the impact of such pre-routing display functionality." On Wednesday, Direct Edge said in a letter to the SEC that NYSE Euronext's comments are "factually inaccurate, are logically inconsistent, and contradict their own market structures, prior policy statements, and marketing materials." Direct Edge, which is not yet an exchange but last month matched 12.6 percent of U.S. stock trades, said its ELP product, as well as Nasdaq's and BATS' proposals, "are part of a broader strategic competitive battle regarding the liquidity-aggregation and other innovative products offered to their customers." The private venue -- owned by International Securities Exchange, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Knight Capital Group and Citadel -- said its optional program reduces transaction costs and improves trading executions.Cove management said hours before of a deadline for investors to accept Shell's bid that it had switched to back an improved 1.22-billion-pound ($1.9 billion) offer from PTT. It had previously supported Shell's offer, which followed a PTT bid that trumped Shell's opening salvo in February. An official within Mozambique's minerals ministry told Reuters the government would prefer a company with LNG expertise, but did not say whether it would block PTT's bid on the basis it had not previously built an LNG export plant.Etsuro Honda, an adviser to Abe and a vocal opponent of the tax hike plan, warned that raising the sales tax now could destroy a golden opportunity to end years of price declines. "Japan is in the process of exiting deflation but is not out of it yet. The economy isn't back in an autonomous recovery phase," he told Reuters on Monday.Allstate's investment portfolio held $113.6 billion at the end of the quarter, a 1.6 percent decline from the prior quarter, due to the capital losses. Allstate said its standard brand auto policy sales were comparable with the same period a year ago, and homeowner policies fell about 0.8 percent. Excluding catastrophe claims, the company's "combined ratio" -- a measure of premiums earned against payouts and expenses -- was 94.4 percent for the quarter, up from 87.6 percent in the second quarter of 2007.ING economist Carsten Brzeski expected Draghi to remain tight lipped. However, he said the scandal would shine a light on the difficulties the ECB faces in building up a euro zone-wide banking supervisory body that is credible but separate from its main business of setting interest rates. "It only stresses that the supervisory role is a hell of a job," said Brzeski.
