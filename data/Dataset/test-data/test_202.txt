WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States has threatened action that could disrupt a French-led satellite maker's supply chain, spurred by suspicion that it illegally used U.S. know-how or parts in spacecraft launched by Chinese rockets.The State Department last month quietly warned the company, Thales Alenia Space, that export licenses needed by its U.S. suppliers might be denied, absent greater cooperation in an investigation of the matter, a department email obtained by Reuters showed.Grammas has served on an industry panel that advises the State Department on defense trade issues. The Thales Group, headquartered in Neuilly-sur-Seine, generates close to 80 percent of its sales outside France, with operations in 50 countries, according to information on its website. Export denials to a rival could be a boost to U.S. manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Orbital Sciences and Space Systems/Loral, a unit of Loral Space & Communications , that have lost as much as half their global satellite market share in recent years The U.S. share of global satellite exports has dropped from about 75 percent in 1995 to between 35 percent and 50 percent in the past seven years, according to Patricia Cooper, president of the Satellite Industry Association, a U.S.-based trade group.ITAR-FREE Edgar Buckley, a Thales Group senior vice president and former NATO assistant secretary-general, said in an emailed statement to Reuters this week that TAS is trying to help the State Department "to resolve any outstanding concerns it may have." A French Embassy spokesman in Washington, Luis Vassy, said the embassy had been involved both to "explain the regulations in place in France with regard to the protection of sensitive items and technologies, and to detail the steps taken to make sure no restricted item or technology imported is unduly exported to a third party." "To our knowledge, no violation by TAS has been observed on ITAR components," he said by email.Washington bars satellites containing U.S. parts and U.S. design know-how from launch by China as part of sanctions imposed after the 1989 crushing of the pro-democracy movement at Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Such U.S. technology is subject to so-called International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, a set of State Department-enforced rules governing arms trade.License refusals could crimp the 2 billion euros ($2.65 billion) in worldwide civil and military sales that the company, known as TAS, posted in 2010. They also could force a costly product-line revamp and strain U.S. ties with France. The threat escalates the United States' multi-year push for details on the design and components of a watershed telecommunications satellite that TAS has labeled as free of U.S. parts and therefore exempt from U.S. export controls.
