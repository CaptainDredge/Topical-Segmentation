The hard fought talks are still ongoing and are unlikely to yield a result until Wednesday's meeting of euro zone ministers at the earliest. The ECB and the 17 euro zone national central banks buy the bonds under what the ECB calls its Securities Markets Programme (SMP). European laws forbid it buying the bonds direct from governments but it gets round the restriction by buying them from banks and other investors on the open market.FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept its controversial government bond purchases to an absolute minimum last week, spending less than 150 million euros for the third week running and shrugging off anxieties surrounding Greece's strained debt deal.The ECB has all but halted its purchases of troubled euro zone debt over the last month and a half, following both a substantial improvement in key euro zone bond markets and the emergence of calls for it to take losses on its Greek bonds.Spain had also enjoyed a blast of positive sentiment, but over the last two weeks the premium investors demand to buy Spanish debt has rising again.. The ECB remains at the centre of a political tug-of-war as it -backed by Germany- continues to resist the earlier calls by France and Italy as well as the United States, Britain and Russia to be more aggressive in its buying.Last week's 59 million euros worth of purchases represents another token signal that the program is still operational and edges the amount the ECB has spent since starting the purchases back in May 2010, up to 219.5 billion euros.
