HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery is poised to complete its purchase of General Motor Corp's Hummer division within days, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.The paper said executives were in Detroit this weekend putting the finishing touches on the deal. A Tengzhong spokesman was not immediately available for comment.The company said the report "cherry-picks information from documents, which mischaracterizes GlaxoSmithKline's comprehensive efforts to research Avandia and communicate those findings to regulators, physicians and patients." Glaxo said it had rigorously studied Avandia's safety and "consistently shared this data with regulators around the world." The company said it "does not condone any effort to silence scientific debate." FDA spokeswoman Karen Riley said on Saturday an advisory panel, a group of outside experts, will be asked "to provide advice about safety issues" with Avandia.(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. banks fell on Thursday.
