The investigations underline China's toughening stance on corruption and high prices in the pharmaceutical industry, as the government seeks to make healthcare access universal and faces an estimated $1 trillion healthcare bill by 2020. Many Chinese prefer foreign brands over local drugs because of the widespread circulation of fake medicine. NOVARTIS IN SPOTLIGHT The latest foreign drugmaker in the spotlight is Switzerland's Novartis AG, after a Chinese newspaper reported that it bribed doctors to boost sales in June and July of this year.

Novartis said it could confirm that a former employee had filed a complaint with the local Chinese labor authority and also made a claim to the drugmaker for compensation. It said it had launched an internal investigation through its business practice office. "Novartis takes allegations of misconduct seriously and will take appropriate actions depending on the findings once the investigation is concluded," the company said in a statement.

Health Ministry officials are also investigating drugmaker Sanofi SA over bribery allegations, something the French company has said it was taking "very seriously". Chinese authorities have also visited sites operated by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S; another Danish firm H.Lundbeck A/S; Britain's AstraZeneca Plc; Eli Lilly & Co and Belgium's UCB SA.

"It seems that the NDRC and SAIC have learned from their recent experience that they have the power to force companies to change their practices and bring prices down," said Sebastien Evrard, Beijing-based partner at law firm Jones Day, which specializes in anti-trust law. "They seem to be willing to exercise their powers in even more sectors that directly concern consumers." The SAIC would hand down severe punishment for bribery found in the bidding process for drugs and medical services as that hurt the interests of the Chinese people, Xinhua said.

This investigation has yet to conclude. Separately, the SAIC said it wanted to prevent China's industry associations from being the "driving force", or organizers, of monopolistic behavior, an official at the SAIC, Cao Hongying, was quoted by Xinhua as saying. Among the 12 monopoly cases that China has announced, nine of them were organized by industry associations, Xinhua said.
