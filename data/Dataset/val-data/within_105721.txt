Under FDA regulations, doctors may prescribe drugs for unapproved, or off-label, use. But pharmaceutical companies are allowed to market their drugs in the United States only for FDA-approved uses. The FDA said it had delivered repeated warnings to Janssen about "misleading marketing messages" to doctors, and later initiated a criminal complaint.

J&J disclosed in a securities filing in 2011 it had reached an agreement to resolve criminal penalties related to the promotion of Risperdal, which was once one of the company's biggest sellers, but that certain issues remained open. The company on Monday said no additional charges will be recorded to earnings in connection with the settlement.

Under the settlement, Janssen will plead guilty to a single misdemeanor violation for its promotion of Rispersdal. Meanwhile, the company paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to Omnicare Inc, the nation's largest pharmacy specializing in dispensing drugs to nursing home patients, under various guises including "educational funding." Johnson & Johnson's conduct "recklessly put at risk" the health of children, dementia patients and others to whom the drug was prescribed at a time it was only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat schizophrenia, Holder said.

From 1999 through 2005, J&J and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc promoted Risperdal for unapproved uses, including controlling aggression and anxiety in elderly dementia patients and treating behavioral disturbances in children and in individuals with disabilities, according to the complaint. The off-label marketing cost U.S. government insurance programs hundreds of millions of dollars in uncovered claims, the complaint said.

Janssen's sales representatives "aggressively" promoted Risperdal to doctors and other prescribers who treated elderly dementia patients, and through a special "ElderCare sales force" targeted nursing home operators. "The company also provided incentives for off-label promotion" and based sales representatives' bonuses on total sales, not just sales for FDA-approved uses, the DOJ said.
