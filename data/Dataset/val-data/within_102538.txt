"Ironically, this crisis over Syria could give everyone a little cover because we're not close to a deal to kill sequester or to raise the debt ceiling. Lawmakers could claim, with justification, that they've been preoccupied with Syria," said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research in Washington. "On the budget, it increases the likelihood of stop-gap stuff," he added.

Last week, some 80 House Republicans sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying they would not support an extension of government funding known as a continuing resolution unless it denied funds needed to implement the Obamacare provisions. Short-term extensions also would provide more uncertainty for financial markets, prolonging the risk to investors of a government shutdowns or default at a time when investors are already in turmoil over the possibility of a wider conflict in the Middle East.

One House Republican aide said the Syria situation "would make it a lot harder for to vote against a debt-ceiling increase given that we're the party that tends to be more hard-line security and military supporters in the Reagan tradition." Some lawmakers entering a classified briefing on the Syria situation on Sunday in Washington acknowledged that the Syria vote would complicate the fiscal agenda, but said dealing with urgent military action was a higher priority.

"I think you have to say that the chance of a short-term extension has increased." The U.S. Treasury said last week that an increase in the $16.7 trillion federal borrowing limit will be needed by mid-October to ensure that the government can continue to meet its payment obligations. Many House Republicans have pledged to use the need to increase the debt ceiling as leverage to demand cuts to federal benefits programs and for delays or the withholding of funds from "Obamacare," President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms.

"I don't know how it's going to complicate other things, but this is the most important thing that we will deal with," said Representative Juan Vargas, a Democrat from southern California. Representative Bennie Thomson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said he hoped that the Syria debate wouldn't spill over into the debt limit, adding "Congress should be able to multi-task." In addition, proposals for short-term funding and debt-ceiling extensions prompted by the Syria time crunch could also be accompanied by demands by conservatives for delays in the implementation of key parts of the Obamacare health reforms, such as the October 1 launch of insurance exchanges for individual coverage, Guggenheim's Krueger said.
