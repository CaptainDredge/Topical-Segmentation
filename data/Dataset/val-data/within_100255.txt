"The media environment here has absolutely changed. Social media has revolutionized what companies do in a crisis situation," said Kent Kedl, in charge of Greater China and North Asia for risk consultancy firm Control Risks.

KFC-parent Yum Brands ( YUM.N ) came under heavy fire from both mainstream and social media after the official China Central Television (CCTV) reported in late December that some of the chicken supplied to KFC and McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) contained excess amounts of antiviral drugs and hormones used to accelerate growth.

"We would never publicly deny what the government says even if it's 100 percent wrong," said the executive who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. "In one case, we simply said 'no comment' for the record while we directly spoke with the government on the issue to sort out the misunderstanding." Kedl, from Control Risks, said an essential part of crisis management in China was building relationships with various wings of the state before any crisis took place.
