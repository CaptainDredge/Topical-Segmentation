"What (Bernanke) has done is create what I call an early summer market storm, not a huge one but enough to cause people to become a little nervous," said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A.

Even with recent losses, the S&P 500 is up 15 percent for the year to date. The benchmark index is down 2.5 percent since May 21, but there have been short-lived rallies in that period. Also the gains in bond yields since Bernanke's comments caused investors to rotate out of high-yielding dividend stocks.

The markets have priced in a sea change and seem to think that rates are going up soon, said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. But "I think the Fed is not going to want that to be the market's impression," he said. The news may be that any change is going to be gradual, he added.
