Construction equipment typifies the trend. China's two sector leaders, Sany Heavy Industry and Zoomlion, have both bought expertise in concrete pump manufacturing by acquiring Putzmeister of Germany and CIFA of Italy respectively. "As we look back 10 years from now, what we will see is that a significant number of companies that are fundamentally China-domestic today will be calling themselves global companies but with Chinese characteristics," said Gordon Orr, a director in Shanghai with consultants McKinsey & Co. The risk for Germany is that in areas less specialized than precision engineering Chinese firms will be able to harness home-grown or acquired technology to economies of scale in a way that Germany, a country 15 times smaller, simply cannot match.

SHARPER EDGE In contrast to Germany, Italy has suffered at the hands of China in traditional consumer sectors such as clothing and footwear, where cheap labor counts for more than technological content and domestic manufacturers have been slow to upgrade. Italy has also been feeling the heat in more advanced, capital-intensive sectors such as electrical machinery, said Giorgia Giovannetti, a professor at the University of Florence.

BERLIN/LONDON  (Reuters) - Confident or complacent, German business executives are bullish about their chances of profiting from China's transition to an economy fired by consumption rather than investment.As China deliberately dampens its long boom in capital spending, Germany will no longer be able to count on windfall gains from exports of the high-quality machinery for which it is renowned.

This strategy is likely to continue to pay off for machine tools, according to InterChina Consulting. It expects the domination of the top end of the market by German and other foreign manufacturers to last another couple of decades. "For China to develop a competitive machine tool industry, important structural and social/behavioral changes are required, which will be difficult and require many years," Long Nanyao wrote in a recent report by the consultancy.

"For German machine builders who have the right machines to make products for Chinese consumers, it's a big opportunity. We have those machines," said Markus Rustler, managing director of Theegarten-Pactec, a manufacturer of confectionery packaging machines based in the eastern city of Dresden. The challenge for Germany will be to fend off competition not only from other economies specializing in capital goods, such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, but also from China, which has been steadily upgrading its industrial structure.
