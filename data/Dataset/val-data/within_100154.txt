Boulton is charged with upholding the 2012 finding against Hannam - a rare success for the much-criticized watchdog. However, the suggestion that the talks were fictitious was made not by Boulton, but by Hannam's lawyers. Part of their argument for having the fine overturned is that by being inaccurate, the contents of the email - and another, later one from Hannam revealing an oil strike by Heritage, could not have been inside information.

The man at the other end of Hannam's emails was Ashti Hawrami, then and still the oil minister of the oil-rich semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. Hannam and Buckingham were hoping to tempt him into a deal that would unlock the region's resource riches, undeveloped for years because of war and political instability.

Bid interest from a third party was the bait. Hannam, who in 2008 was also helping broker closer ties between affiliated investment banks JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) and Cazenove as crisis gripped financial markets, was joined in the courtroom by David Davis, a leading British Conservative politician and supporter of the former soldier and his campaign.

Hannam resigned from JP Morgan Cazenove last year, leaving his position as global chairman of equity capital markets after two decades at the firm, to pursue his appeal. The FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), alleged Hannam sent two emails on behalf of Heritage Oil in September and October 2008, which included potential inside information.

It will also fuel a debate about what constitutes inside, or market-moving, information. Hannam was banned by his employer from December 2009 from initiating or soliciting new business or attending meetings without an "approved person." An ex-special forces soldier known for multi-billion-dollar deals that transformed Britain's blue-chip share index, Hannam said on Tuesday as the case began that he did not believe he broke any rules.
