To address labour issues and speed growth in Europe, Indian companies have been acquiring local firms. To win client trust, they hire locally for senior client-facing roles, but most of the grunt work can be done from India. Jef Loos, head of sourcing research at Whitelane Research in Brussels, said Indian vendors moving into Germany, France, Spain and Italy will use acquisitions given language barriers, a "limited" outsourcing culture, and stronger unions.

For European companies, many of them battered by a prolonged economic slowdown, Indian IT firms offer cost advantages to using local vendors or doing the work in-house. Global rivals such as IBM ( IBM.N ) and Capgemini ( CAPP.PA ) also have big operations in India that can take advantage of lower costs.

"Europe has been a very conservative market compared with the U.S.," said Sharat Kumar, head of delivery for Europe at No. 5 Indian player Tech Mahindra ( TEML.NS ), whose European clients include food giant Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ) and aerospace firm EADS ( EAD.PA ). "The customers are conservative in starting the initiative, but once they do, these are the customers that don't just go back and forth or drop it, so what we've seen is that there is a lot more stability in the European customer," he said.

BANGALORE  (Reuters) - India's IT outsourcers, long bit players in continental Europe, are looking to win over more people like Hans-Petter Aanby.Aanby is chief information officer of Scandinavian Airlines System SASSA.UL, which recently awarded Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) ( TCS.NS ) a five-year contract worth over $160 million as part of its effort to halve information technology costs and reduce local IT staff by 70 percent by 2015.

Big Indian IT companies, heavily reliant on the U.S. market and eager to diversify, have intensified efforts to crack continental Europe in the past three years through acquisitions, setting up operations on the ground and hiring locally. The push into Europe comes as Indian IT vendors face uncertainty in the United States, where more restrictive rules that could drive up the costs of sending workers there on short-term visas are being debated as part of an immigration law overhaul.
