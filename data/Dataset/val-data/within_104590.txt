Before long, Yellen narrowed her many interests to economics, Grosart said. "After she took her first economics course, economics was her favorite topic, and that's what we talk about on the phone," Grosart said. "Everyone's trying to figure out what makes Janet tick. As far as I'm concerned, what makes her tick is that she's a caring and thoughtful person who loves this country." As a boy, Rich Rubin, a retired professor of medicine who spent nine grades with Yellen and now lives in Portland, Oregon, said he frequently visited the Yellen home, where Yellen's mother, Anna, held meetings as den mother to a troop of Cub Scouts.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - To some who knew Janet Yellen decades ago, her nomination to lead the Federal Reserve was no surprise, and had them feeling reassured the country's monetary system would be in capable hands."We referred to her as a stealth intellect," said Charles Saydah, a retired journalist who went to junior high and Fort Hamilton High School in New York's Brooklyn borough with Yellen.

"In Janet's mother's eyes, he was a suitable mate for her daughter because, when he fulfilled a reading assignment, instead of reading a comic book like all the other boys, he came in and talked about reading 'Treasure Island,'" Saydah said. But the childhood romance fizzled. It turned out the boy failed to meet Anna Yellen's standards.

Though many of New York's most prestigious schools were still not open to girls in the 1950s and 1960s, no one questioned Yellen's academic future. "Janet could've run with any of those kids who went to Stuyvesant (High School)," Saydah said. "She was as smart as they were." As a teen, Yellen seemingly excelled at so many subjects that her friends were uncertain where she would make her mark.

"Later it became clear to Janet's mother that he'd read the comic-book version of 'Treasure Island,'" Saydah explained. She would go on to marry and collaborate professionally with George Akerlof, himself an accomplished economist who shared a Nobel Prize in 2001. (Editing by  Daniel Trotta  and  Tim Dobbyn )
