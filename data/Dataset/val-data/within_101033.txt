Products by the satellite communication systems maker include terminals used to transmit results from far-flung polling stations in this year's elections in the Philippines. NewSat's Ballintine and other industry players said satellite operators will more than make up for the huge upfront investments as they stand to pocket up to 80 percent of their revenues as gross profits.

OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS Singapore Technologies Electronics, a unit of defense conglomerate Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd ( STEG.SI ), has already set up a unit to build and operate observation satellites with help from two local state-funded universities. The government has also agreed to bear part of the cost to hire more researchers at smaller firms such as Addvalue Technologies Ltd ( AVAU.SI ).

"If you speak to professionals from the space industry, they'll tell you that one of their biggest challenges is analyzing the enormous amount of satellite data they are generating," he said. "You do not have to go for capital-intensive operations and at the same time have very high margins." According to the Space Foundation, a U.S.-based industry body, the global space economy grew 6.7 percent to $304.3 billion last year.

Satellite-based surveillance systems are also in high demand to monitor everything from forest fires to illegal migrants trying to get to Australia by boat, Ballintine said. High-quality images of so-called hot spots in Sumatra are currently in demand after bush fires on the Indonesian island produced a thick haze that smothered neighboring Singapore and Malaysia earlier this year.

Adrian Ballintine, founder and chief executive of Australian satellite firm NewSat Ltd ( NWT.AX ), which has an office in Singapore, said growth areas include providing high-speed Internet services to airline passengers. Singapore Airlines Ltd ( SIAL.SI ) said last year it will provide wi-fi and mobile phone connectivity on its long-haul flights using services provided by Inmarsat.
