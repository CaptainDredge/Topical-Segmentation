The agency earlier suffered a setback when a judge for the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia sided with bank groups who argued that it had not sufficiently argued what the benefits of its rules were, and struck them down. Its two-pronged legal strategy of appealing the decision while at the same time rewriting the rule has raised eyebrows, even with some people inside the agency.

It would drop an important irritant for the bank groups who fought the rule before the court, by allowing broad exemptions for positions held by firms in which they own minority stakes of between 10 and 50 percent, as long as the banks can prove they don't control the firms. The original rule set the threshold for aggregating positions at 10 percent, a level the industry had found "draconian", according to the first source.

"The (traders) are going to have some problems with this proposal. I think the banks are going to be happier," the first source said. CONDITIONAL LIMITS MAKE COME-BACK The CFTC is also planning to reintroduce so-called conditional limits, which means parties can hold as much as 125 percent of the deliverable supply of a particular commodity as long as they hold no physically settled futures.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator is finishing a new rule to curb speculators with large positions in commodity markets that is in parts tougher than the previous version, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan said.Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler is rushing to get a revamped rule out before his term runs out in December, said the sources, even while agency lawyers are preparing to defend the original position limits rule that was knocked back by a U.S. court last year.

CME Group ( CME.O ) had fiercely lobbied against this, because the futures exchange felt it would deter trading in the physical delivery futures contract, where they generally have no competitors, the first source said. The position limits will be imposed for 28 physical comodity futures contracts, ranging from grains to milk and feeder cattle and cocoa, as well as four energy contracts traded on NYMEX and five COMEX and NYMEX metals contracts.
