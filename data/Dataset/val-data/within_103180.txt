All three banks declined to comment. Although SocGen does not break out country details for the private bank, the Asia business may account for around 10 billion euros to 12 billion euros of assets under management, according to Jean-Pierre Lambert, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. The potential sale of its Asian private bank would be the next step in a series of initiatives the French bank has taken to cut costs and boost profits.

While Asia is among the fastest growing regions in the world for individual wealth, its millionaires and billionaires tend to offer small chunks of their riches to many wealth managers, rather than picking one to preserve over time. That goes counter to the pattern in the U.S. and Europe where private bank clients tend to hand over their money to the managers for the long haul.

Private bankers in Asia often remark that because the money they receive is usually first or second generation wealth, they act more like brokers than private bankers - an arrangement that can be costly. Standard Chartered Bank plc, Singapore's United Overseas Bank Ltd and DBS Group Holding Ltd are among the companies that may express interest in the business, according to the people familiar with the matter.

Another is the growing separation between the big and smaller players in the field. The world's top 5 private banks have around 50 percent of assets under management in the industry, according to consulting firm Scorpio Partnership, showing how the industry is consolidated around a few top players. UBS and Citigroup for example, both manage over $200 billion each in Asia-Pacific.

OCBC paid a net multiple of 5.8 percent for ING's Asian private bank, which was managing $16 billion when the deal was announced in late 2009, allowing the Singapore lender to triple its private banking assets. The sale of SocGen's private bank in Asia, one of only a few managing more than $10 billion, is expected to attract suitors ranging from global lenders to major regional banks in Asia, people familiar with the matter said.
