In a research note issued earlier this week, Dwivedi said stocks at Cushing could fall to 20 million barrels by the end of November. "If Cushing levels test operational minimums, the WTI-Brent spread could go positive," he wrote in the note. (Reporting by  Sabina Zawadzki ; Editing by  Bob Burgdorfer )

With total shell capacity at almost 80 million barrels, according to Reuters calculations (see above), that would point to a minimum operational level of at least 8 million barrels. Vikas Dwivedi, analyst at Macquarie Capital, estimates the minimum at 16 million barrels based on calculating how much is needed for maintaining floating roofs and enabling smooth operations at optimal pressure levels.

A spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners ( MMP.N ), the third largest storage operator at Cushing with capacity of 12 million barrels, said its facilities would need up to 10 percent volume of the shell capacity to "maintain normal operations". But, Shaw said operators would usually have another extra few percentage points to maintain a practical level.
