It is seeking to bar Cohen from the financial industry and from managing other people's money. In March, SAC agreed to pay a record $616 million penalty to settle a lawsuit arising from an investigation of trading on illegal information. Some observers had thought the settlement would end much of SAC and Cohen's troubles, but it did not.

The SEC charges stem from a six-year probe of Cohen and his $15 billion hedge fund by regulators and federal investigators in which nine one-time SAC employees have been charged or implicated. Cohen, reputed to be one of the best traders of his generation, has emerged as the primary focus of the federal government's crackdown on insider trading in the $2.4 trillion hedge fund industry.

That has not happened so far. "They are obviously trying to shut him down," said one investor with SAC Capital who declined to be identified. The investor said it would appear there will be no criminal charge against Cohen, but regulators have decided to use what they can to force him out of business.

Lawyers said that in a civil proceeding, Cohen could assert his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination as he did in the criminal investigation. But the judge in the proceeding would be entitled to draw a "negative inference" from Cohen's refusal to answer specific questions. "I think they don't have the evidence for insider trading so they brought this," Thomas Gorman, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney who is not connected to the case, said of the SEC charges against Cohen.

A vote outside of the normal meeting time can come up if the SEC is racing to beat the statute of limitations on filing a charge, the source said. Commissioner Troy Paredes was on a plane when the rest of the group met. He cast his vote when he landed in Texas.
