LONDON  (Reuters) - Mining companies were too slow to respond to changing investor demands from mid-2011 as sentiment deteriorated, failing to spot the wave of change which eventually swept out a generation of executives, the former boss of miner Rio Tinto said on Tuesday."We didn't react fast enough," said Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) ( RIO.AX ) until he was ousted in January - one of a string of executives toppled by writedowns at the world's largest mining firms, as boom-year deals soured.

"The market is going to be weak this year and for a period of time," he said. "I look at that, from a mining perspective, as the time to go for consolidation, to build the foundation for the next few years ... to strengthen your position for what should be a pretty good run."

"At that point the sentiment changed very quickly - a matter of three weeks - and it never turned. It probably took us 18 months to get that." Albanese left Rio in January 2013, ending his six-year tenure at the top after the world's third-largest mining company announced a $14 billion writedown almost entirely on the value of his two most significant acquisitions, the Alcan aluminum group and Mozambican coal.

Instead of demanding more growth, investors had begun to feel nervous. "It felt like panic was setting in... We said this is not us, this is not our problem. We should have said this is us, this is our problem," the U.S.-born mining veteran said, in one of his first public appearances since his departure from Rio.

He announced last month he had taken a senior advisory role at Indian mining firm Vedanta ( VED.L ). But he said on Tuesday there would be opportunities for rivals who, like Xstrata's Mick Davis or Vale's ( VALE5.SA ) Roger Agnelli, have chosen private firms to pursue deals at a time he said would prove fruitful as some firms struggle - ahead of an improvement in the sector from 2015.
