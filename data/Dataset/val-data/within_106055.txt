The courtroom was full to the brim, with senior officials from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office lining the back, surrounded by various deputies. Cohen himself did not attend; nor did Bharara. Under the plea agreement SAC reached with prosecutors, the hedge fund has agreed to pay $900 million in penalties to resolve the criminal case unveiled against it in July.

U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain said she would refrain from deciding about whether to accept the plea until after she read the pre-sentencing report. She scheduled the sentencing hearing for March 14. "Financial institutions should know that they are not automatically immune from prosecution, and we will hold companies, as well as individuals, accountable wherever appropriate," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement released after the hearing.

As part of the plea, Nussbaum listed former employees who had been convicted of insider trading charges and described their offenses. "On behalf of SAC, I want to express our deep remorse for the misconduct of each individual who broke the law while employed at SAC," he said. "This happened on our watch, and we are responsible for that misconduct." Ethan Wohl, a lawyer for investors in a lawsuit related to another pending SAC insider trading case, urged Swain not to accept the plea.

A federal judge on Wednesday signed-off on another $900 million judgment in the companion civil forfeiture action filed at the same time against SAC. Under the civil deal, the hedge fund will only have to pay $284 million, after getting credit for $616 million in settlements in related insider trading cases by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

SAC has reserved its right to withdraw its plea if Swain does not impose the penalties negotiated with prosecutors. BROADER MISCONDUCT? Arlo Devlin-Brown, an assistant U.S. attorney, said had the case gone to trial, evidence would have shown "the insider trading at SAC was not limited to these six individuals." The evidence would show that the insider trading was "facilitated by institutional failures," he said, such as hiring process that disproportionately emphasized hiring people with proven access to insiders without any effort to guard against insider trading; compliance failures, such as the failures to monitor trading; and the "tone set by senior management." SAC wanted an "informational edge," he said, but there was an "institutional indifference as to whether that information was lawfully obtained." Indeed, a source familiar with the investigation told Reuters on Friday investigators were still probing SAC trades in two other stocks and were still interested in looking at new angles on a series of trades that have been closely examined in several cases where convictions have already resulted.
