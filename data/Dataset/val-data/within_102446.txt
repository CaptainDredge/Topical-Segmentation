Malec, chief executive of Chicago-based futures firm Attain Capital Management, said in the email that NFA leaders have ignored complaints about its performance this year. He sent it to NFA members known as introducing brokers, or IBs, who accept orders to buy and sell futures contracts from customers but do not hold their money.

CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A U.S. futures industry regulator is falling short in its attempt to keep tabs on brokers and asset managers, more than a year after the collapse of one brokerage under its oversight that cost clients hundreds of millions of dollars, according to one of the regulator's directors.Jeff Malec, who was elected to the National Futures Association (NFA) board of directors earlier this year, told brokers in an email this month that the regulator "isn't doing all that it could" to protect futures traders and urged them to complain about it.

"We always strive to do better." Malec, whose firm had money at Peregrine when it failed, was one of the NFA's biggest critics after the collapse. He declined to comment on the email. Peregrine's failure shook confidence in the futures industry less than a year after the collapse of larger brokerage MF Global.

"If you feel (like I do) that the NFA isn't doing all that it could (that someone should be fired over PFG ... Review processes are a mess. That the teams that come in and audit your IB are dangerously inexperienced...) please let those thoughts be known," Malec wrote in an August 5 email.

The email was obtained by Reuters. The NFA, which is based in Chicago and funded by industry fees, has long operated in relative obscurity, overshadowed by better-known market regulators like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That changed last year after brokerage Peregrine Financial Group, known as PFG, failed due to a 20-year fraud that the company's founder perpetrated despite yearly audits by the NFA.
