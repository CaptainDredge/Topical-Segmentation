The UAW, which lost membership in the past three decades to automation and a cutback of jobs at General Motors Co ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler Group LLC, wants to organize VW workers to gain a toehold in the U.S. South, where most foreign automakers have non-union factories.

Volkswagen said in September that it was in talks with the UAW about establishing such a labor council at the Chattanooga plant, which would be a first for the U.S. union. In Germany, a works council represents both blue-collar and white-collar workers. It represents employees on work rules in the plants and some other dealings with the company, but wages and benefits are negotiated by IG Metall.

ThyssenKrupp has a steel plant in Alabama. "Low wages and union-free areas: That's not a business model that the IG Metall would support," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. "If companies - from VW to ThyssenKrupp - entered these (southern U.S.) states in order to be free of unions, meaning to not acknowledge a fundamental pillar of any democracy, then we're in North Korea.

Meanwhile, VW's top labor leader, Bernd Osterloh, is scheduled to travel to Tennessee to meet with Gov. Bill Haslam and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the former mayor of Chattanooga, to discuss Osterloh's desire that VW's Tennessee workers are represented through a German-style works council. Both Haslam and Corker have voiced opposition to the UAW's efforts at the VW plant.

Osterloh is an IG Metall member. A person familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified, earlier said that the visit would take place in mid-November, but Osterloh's spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Haslam had no immediate comment, while a spokeswoman for Corker could not be reached.
