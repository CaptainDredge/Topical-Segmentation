LONDON  (Reuters) - BP ( BP.L ) is working on becoming the first oil major with a long-term deal to buy seaborne crude from Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ), trade sources said, after a number of trading houses this year secured large volumes from the Kremlin energy champion.While trading houses Glencore ( GLEN.L ), Vitol and Trafigura agreed to lend Rosneft $11.5 billion in exchange for oil supplies over five years, oil majors have largely stayed on the sidelines, preferring to buy Russian crude at spot tenders.

So everyone realized that something new is coming," a trader at a rival company said. Trading sources said BP would be allocated a total of two Urals cargoes from Rosneft in the Baltic during October. Sources declined to give exact details on how the two cargoes would fit into the new term deal.

BP owns a fifth of Rosneft, which became the world's largest listed oil firm by output after acquiring BP's venture in Russia, TNK-BP, in a deal valued at more than $50 billion. That left Rosneft, in which the Kremlin owns a controlling stake, heavily indebted and looking for deals with the likes of Glencore to lighten the burden on its balance sheet by reducing debts to banks as the money is being borrowed by the traders.

Long-term deals with Rosneft allowed trading houses such as Glencore and Vitol to build large positions in Urals, the most important crude grade for European refiners. But the deals also turned expensive as they are priced against Rosneft's six-month tenders, in which majors and traders often bid up prices to win volumes.

The first signs that BP is working on a new deal emerged when the major offered to sell a cargo of Urals in the Baltic Sea for early-October delivery, traders said. "BP was simply not supposed to have this cargo as it didn't win any volumes from Rosneft in the latest six-month tender.
