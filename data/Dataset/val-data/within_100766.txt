Yahoo's ad focus has, however, centered on "on developing media units that were much better for premium buys," said Shar VanBoskirk, an analyst with industry research firm Forrester Research. Yahoo has its own programmatic ad technology with its Right Media exchange. But analysts say the exchange is not as popular as rival offerings, such as Google's DoubleClick exchange, which is considered the industry standard.

Marketers increasingly prefer to buy online advertising space through automated exchanges, where prices are significantly lower, rather than paying top-dollar for premium ads sold by a Web publisher's salesforce. Ads offered by exchanges also allow marketers to aim ads in real time at specific audiences, such as by gender or age.

Facebook is likely to expand its market share to 16.5 percent, research house eMarketer estimates. "This core business is going to be ugly for quite some time before it gets better," BGC analyst Colin Gillis said of Yahoo. "This is just the beginning of the trend, of the drop in the price per ad.

SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Marissa Mayer's plan to resuscitate Yahoo seems a simple one: get back the eyeballs, sell more ads and charge higher prices. But the chief executive's plan seems to have run into a major snag.The price the company charges per ad slid 12 percent in the April to June period, six times the decline just a quarter ago - a fall that some say highlights how Yahoo has been caught unprepared for the industry shift to automated, programmatic ad buying.

But even if Yahoo's ad exchange becomes more competitive, the broader trend of programmatic advertising will continue to pressure its business. "Programmatic advertising technology continues to have a downward bias to pricing in display advertising and I don't expect that to improve anytime soon," said UBS analyst Eric Sheridan. ONE YEAR MARK Mayer took the reins at Yahoo in July 2012 after a tumultuous period in which the company churned through several CEOs and many of its top executives and engineers jumped ship.
