An asterisk next to a name denotes the person is a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. *SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JOHN WILLIAMS, November 5 "We are not seeing signs of rising inflation on the horizon." *WILLIAMS, November 2 "The calendar date has been pretty effective at aligning expectations with our own views...There's a little bit in my mind of, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'"

MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA, October 30 "Given how high unemployment is expected to remain over the next few years, these inflation forecasts suggest that monetary policy is, if anything, too tight, not too easy." *RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, October 26 "Improvement in labor market conditions appears to have been held back by real impediments that are beyond the capacity of monetary policy to offset...In such circumstances, further monetary stimulus runs the risk of raising inflation in a way that threatens the stability of inflation expectations." FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE STATEMENT, October 24 "The committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions."
