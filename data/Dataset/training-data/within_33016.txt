Nissan, 44 percent-owned by Renault SA, now expects an operating loss -- its first in 14 years -- of 180 billion yen ($2 billion) for the year to March 31, instead of the 270 billion yen profit it projected three months ago. Consensus forecasts from 19 analysts had put the loss at 70 billion yen.

Last week, Toyota Motor Corp tripled its annual operating loss forecast citing a faster-than-expected sales slump in the main U.S., Japanese and European markets. Honda Motor Co also cut its forecast last month, but expects to stay in the black. In the year to March 31, Nissan said it would produce 3,069,000 vehicles, or 20 percent less than it had planned at the start of the business year.

Nissan's shares have dived more than 70 percent in the last 12 months, while Toyota and Honda are down 47 percent and 30 percent. Nissan has shed $12 billion in market value since Ghosn arrived from Renault to rescue Nissan in 1999. Nissan's shares are the worst performer in the domestic auto sector in the year to date, falling 13 percent against a 7 percent rise in Tokyo's transport sub-index.

Saddled with excess capacity and headcount and with sales plummeting in developed markets, Japan's No.3 automaker has already taken a number of steps to cut production and staff, including through 1,200 voluntary buyouts in the United States. With these and other measures, including reducing 12,000 jobs in Japan mostly through natural attrition, Nissan said it would reduce groupwide headcount by a total 20,000 by the end of March 2010, equivalent to 8.5 percent of the workforce.

Nissan expects its net loss at 265 billion yen instead of a 160 billion yen profit. "Earnings are going to be bad at automakers for some time," said Tomomi Yamashita, senior fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management. "You've got the currency problem and the amount of production adjustment that's ahead," he said, adding that automakers could be in the red for a few more quarters.
