WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will approve a $2 billion extension of the "cash for clunkers" auto sales incentive by week's end, Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday, giving new life to a successful program that has boosted industry sales to a 2009 high.Reid told reporters after a White House meeting between Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama that there was enough support in the chamber to give the measure final congressional approval.

The National Automobile Dealers Association and the government believe once a backlog is cleared in tallying sales, the initial $1 billion for "clunker" rebates will have been nearly exhausted. Overseas manufacturers captured six of the top-10 sales spots. All but one were cars rather than trucks or SUVs. Toyota Motor Corp had three, the Prius, Camry and Corolla, among the leaders, while Honda Motor Co Ltd had two, the Civic and Fit.

Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson suggests the fast start of the "clunker" initiative and strong prospects for extended funding could accelerate automaker plans for production increases. The White House has said the timetable for Senate action this week would have to be met or the "clunker" program would cease. A senior administration official cast a more confident note on Tuesday despite fears among thousands of dealers that the extension would be blocked or slowed by Senate procedure.

"This program is moving forward," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said at a news conference. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell raised the prospect of possible amendments but a Republican leadership aide said it did not appear the votes were there to change the bill. Any alteration to the House-passed measure would delay the extension until September, when lawmakers return from vacation.

The House left town July 31. Separately, Transportation Department figures showed sales nearing 160,000 vehicles in connection with "clunker" trade-ins, representing more than $450 million in federal vouchers, since July 1. Dealers in Michigan, where U.S. automakers and many suppliers are based and reeling economically due to industry hardships, reported $34.4 million in "clunker" sales, the highest for any state.
