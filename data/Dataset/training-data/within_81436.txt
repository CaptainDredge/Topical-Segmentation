"It's been 'buy the rumor, sell the news' on the Greek election vote, with people quickly cashing in last week's gains," said Frederic Rozier, a fund manager at Meeschaert Wealth Management, in Paris. "We're back to worries about Spain and a distrust in the euro zone in general. The question on everyone's mind is: at which level do Spanish bond yields become unbearable?" The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds hit a fresh high of above 7 percent on Monday, a key threshold above which borrowing costs become too expensive for a country to afford over the long term.

Global miner BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) added 1.6 percent, German tech firm Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ) gained 3.2 percent and Swiss pharma group Novartis ( NOVN.VX ) rose 1.2 percent. Greek stocks also gained ground, with Eurobank EFGr.AT surging 14.7 percent and telecom group OTE ( OTEr.AT ) adding 11.4 percent, after voters handed conservatives which back the country's bailout deal a narrow election victory, breaking political deadlock and easing worries about a sudden exit from the euro.

"The Greek vote has just been a sideshow on the euro zone debt crisis. Investors' focus is now back on the structural problems faced by both Italy and Spain," Natixis analyst Alex Koagne said. "As long as there won't be monetization of sovereign debts, the crisis will go on. At some point, the ECB needs to get more powers like the Fed or the Bank of England and buy debt from troubled countries directly on the primary market." While dumping euro zone peripheral stocks, investors turned to other European markets seen as safer, with Germany's DAX index  .GDAXI  rising 0.3 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index  .FTSE  adding 0.2 percent and Switzerland's SSMI index  .SSMI  gaining 0.5 percent.
