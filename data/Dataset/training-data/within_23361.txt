Ford also took a $5.3-billion charge to write down the value of its North American operations to reflect its more cautious view that the  boom for trucks and SUVs that took off in the 1990s will not return. Standard & Poor's equity analyst Efraim Levy warned the shift to smaller vehicles would be costly, but said Ford's plan would deliver lower costs and better flexibility over time.

Ford ended the second quarter with a cash position of $26.6 billion down $2.1 billion from the first quarter. "We're confident that we have enough liquidity to get through," Chief Financial Don Leclair told reporters. Calyon Securities Mark Warnsman said in a note he was "cautiously optimistic" about Ford's future but said the time it would take the automaker to complete its turnaround represented a risk for investors.

"The problem is that this has been done in the past and yet the company is now taking further write-offs." Ford took a $2.1-billion charge to write down the value of leases written by its Ford Motor Credit finance unit. About 85 percent of the charge reflected a sharper-than-projected decline in the resale values of light trucks.

The latest turnaround plan assumes that Ford's three core brands -- Ford, Lincoln and Mercury -- would maintain about a 14-percent market share in North America. In May, Ford abandoned a long-standing goal of returning to profitability in 2009 and said it would delay the launch of its redesigned F-150 truck by two months to sell down inventory.

Ford said it was on track to cut 15 percent of its white-collar expenses by August 1 and would cut more deeply in 2009 after reducing recurring costs by $5 billion by year end. Executives declined to offer a timeline for returning to profitability after more than $15 billion of losses the past two years, citing the industry's continued uncertainty.
