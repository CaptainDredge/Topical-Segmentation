Hester said RBS would probably sell about 25 percent of Citizens through a share sale in New York around two years from now. The bank said it also expected to float a batch of 315 branches in Britain that had been earmarked for a sale to Santander ( SAN.MC ), which pulled out of the deal in October.

Hester said there were a lack of buyers for UK bank assets at present, so a share sale using the Williams & Glyn's brand was now its "baseline" plan. European competition authorities ordered RBS to sell the branches as a consequence of taking state aid. The bank said it expected to ask for an extension to an end-2013 deadline to shed the branches.

"The light at the end of the tunnel is coming closer," Chief Executive Stephen Hester said on Thursday. "Our job is to deliver a company that is doing its job well and that other investors will want to invest in." RBS made an operating profit of 3.5 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) last year, up from 1.8 billion the year before and the highest since its 2008 bailout.

LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) has reported its strongest underlying profit since the financial crisis, potentially paving the way for Britain to sell its 82 percent stake if some big hurdles are overcome.The bank had to be rescued in a 45.5 billion pound ($68.9 billion) state bailout during 2008 but the government has begun looking at ways to sell off its holding as RBS starts to return to financial health.

Finance Minister George Osborne welcomed RBS's plans to shrink its investment bank further. "I want to see RBS as a British-based bank, focused on serving British businesses and consumers, with a smaller international investment bank to support that activity rather than to rival it," he said on Thursday. CITIZENS SALE RBS said it planned to sell part of its U.S. business Citizens in the next two years and would likely float a batch of 315 UK branches it has struggled to offload.
