On September 11, for example, J.P. Morgan executives met and decided that the collateral Lehman had posted "was not worth nearly what Lehman claimed it was worth," the report says. The next day, J.P. Morgan asked for an additional $5 billion in collateral. About that time, J.P. Morgan discovered that one of the securities posted by Lehman, an asset-backed security known as Fenway, was "worth practically nothing as collateral." In the report, the examiner raised questions about whether JPMorgan had acted "in good faith" but also detailed an interview in which Dimon said he told Fuld in every conversation "that he did not want to harm Lehman." The examiner found Lehman could have potential claims against JPMorgan, which is still holding about $6.9 billion of Lehman's collateral, and Citi in connection with collateral demands and guaranty agreements in Lehman's final days that hurt its liquidity.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of Standard & Poor's sovereign ratings, David Beers told "Fox News Sunday" he did not expect "that much impact" when global markets open on Monday due to what he called a "mild deterioration" in the U.S. credit standing to AA-plus from top-tier AAA.Asked about the prospects for a further lowering of the U.S. rating, Beers said, the agency's negative outlook meant that "risks are on the downside." He also said the downgrade announced on Friday was not due to the budget positions of any political party and that on any future agreement, "We think credibility would mean any agreement would command support from both political parties." Beers called the U.S. Treasury Department's criticism of the credit rating agency's analysis a "complete misrepresentation." Even with the debt limit agreement passed by Congress, he said, "the underlying debt burden of the U.S. is rising and will continue to rise over the next decade."

In this situation, though, HP's board disclosed the alleged fraud itself, Quinn said. Even if the bankers and lawyers escape any legal problems, they could suffer a reputational hit.
