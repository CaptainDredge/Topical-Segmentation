Rehabilitation of the oil, housing, agriculture and power sectors are seen as most pressing. The head of Iraq's National Investment Commission, Sami al-Araji, said in July the country had secured around $6 billion in investment for licensed projects so far this year. Examples of deals include a $472 million contract with Italy's Saipem ( SPMI.MI ) for an oil export facility expansion and sub-sea pipeline and a 100,000-unit housing project with South Korea's Hanwha Engineering & Construction.

Iraq is trying to rebuild after decades of war and economic sanctions and needs investment in every sector. The OPEC member country has signed a series of deals with international firms to develop its oil fields, the fourth-biggest in the world. Foreign investors like oil majors Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) and BP ( BP.L ) and bank HSBC ( HSBA.L ) are already pouring billions of dollars into Iraq and a U.S. pullout will likely not thwart foreign firms for an extended period, especially those with long-standing interests in the country.

For investors on the ground, primary concerns center around kidnapping threats and attacks on development sites. Oil pipelines are targeted by insurgents in the north and south. Some production at the southern Rumaila oilfield was stopped this month when two bombs hit pipelines. Most foreign companies with a footprint in Iraq hire personal security guards for their protection and analysts say it is unlikely the departure of U.S. troops by year-end will raise extensive concern.

"Any impact on investment will be short-term and quite muted, assuming the security situation doesn't deteriorate drastically," said Economist Intelligence Unit's Ali al-Saffar. "This is primarily because Iraq has only really managed to attract (beyond the oil sector), frontier investors who have some level of appetite for risk so far. These more adventurous investors know the risks associated with doing business in the country, and have become quite adept at dealing with them." Iraqi security forces continue to battle a stubborn Sunni insurgency and Shi'ite militias, and bombings and killings still occur on a daily basis despite a sharp drop in violence from the height of sectarian fighting in 2006-07.

BAGHDAD  (Reuters) - Foreign investors eager to snap up development projects in key oil producer Iraq are unlikely to balk after the United States withdraws all its troops at the end of the year as long as security does not deteriorate.U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday all U.S. forces would leave Iraq at the end of 2011 as scheduled, almost nine years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.
