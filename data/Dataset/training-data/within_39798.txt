The New York Post reported JPMorgan could acquire CIT's factoring unit, which finances more than $50 billion of wholesale inventory, at a time of the year when the collapse of the lender could disrupt retailers holidays plans. CIT declined to comment earlier on Friday and was not available later. But analysts cooled expectations of an asset sale.

LIMITED OPTIONS The company sought additional help even after gaining the status of bank holding company in December so it could draw $2.33 billion of taxpayer money from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. But the Obama administration declined help, saying it had set high standards for granting aid to companies and leaving private investors as the one alternative to avoid collapse.

Still, the ripples of a collapse could be widespread and worsen the effects of the economic downturn for some firms. CIT has about $40 billion of long-term debt, according to independent research firm CreditSights. About $1.1 billion of debt will come due in August, followed by about $2.5 billion by year end.

The focus of talks turned to the bondholders after earlier negotiations with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc about short-term financing out of court did not result in a deal, the source said. JPMorgan and Goldman, along with Barclays PLC and Morgan Stanley, which is also advising the company, might still take part in a DIP financing should the lender go that route, the source said.

The impact of CIT's demise would likely pale by comparison with the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers Inc last September, analysts said. "If they can't survive, the market will resolve this for them and move on. I don't see massive systematic disruptions if CIT will not exist three months from now," said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management.
