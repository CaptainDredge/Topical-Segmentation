Trade Minster Kamal Nath has said the government was looking at all options to help Satyam. He did not elaborate further, but one option could be for a government or private sector bailout. A share index for India's outsourcing sector gained nearly 4 percent on better-than-expected third-quarter earnings at second-ranked outsourcer Infosys Technologies Infosys posted October-December net profit of 16.4 billion rupees, beating a Reuters poll consensus for 15.4 billion rupees.

The damaging fraud, dubbed "India's Enron," has cast doubt over whether Satyam can survive. "Right now, institutional interest in the stock is a lot less, but from a risk and return point of view, any price below 20 rupees is a good entry point for some quick profits," Chakraborty said. The new Satyam board met for the first time on Monday and said the company needed to restate its accounts and swiftly appoint senior people, but it would take time to get back on track.

Satyam founder Ramalinga Raju resigned as chairman last week, saying profits had been falsified for years and about $1 billion, or 94 percent of the company's cash and bank balances at end-September, did not exist. Satyam, which counts Nestle and General Electric among its clients, has seen its market value plunge to below $500 million from more than $7 billion last summer.

"The board members have come in, so the message is quite loud and clear that the government is serious about Satyam. But we have to give them time as they need to understand things first," said Amabreesh Baliga, vice president at Karvy Stock Broking. Satyam shares were down around 4 percent at 33 rupees in early Mumbai trade.

A first priority is to appoint an independent accountant. Satyam, which means 'truth' in Sanksrit, is struggling to pay its 53,000 workforce and needs immediate funding, though Deepak Parekh, a senior banker and one of the new board members, said that if reported receivables were correct the company should have adequate liquidity.
