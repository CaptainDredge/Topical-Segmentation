NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge fund Marathon Asset Management has withdrawn a request for an independent investigator to examine the books of American Airlines, a unit of bankrupt AMR Corp, lawyers for the companies said at a hearing on Thursday.The move came after AMR agreed to preserve potential clawback claims relating to debt deals, struck between Marathon and AMR, that left American Airlines with $2.26 billion of debt.

-----

AMR entered bankruptcy last November, and is considering its options for emerging either as a standalone firm or to merge with smaller competitor US Airways Group, which is making an aggressive takeover push. Marathon, which has said it holds "well over" $100 million of AMR debt, last month sought an examiner to probe intercompany transactions consummated in the weeks before AMR's Chapter 11 filing.

-----

US Airways would like to acquire AMR out of bankruptcy, while a group of debtholders including JPMorgan Chase & Co has expressed interest in financing a standalone exit. AMR received court permission at Thursday's hearing to extend for 30 days, through January 28, its unilateral control of its bankruptcy exit plan.

-----

That could spook investors assessing the company's stability going forward, and AMR's creditors' committee has said labor peace with pilots is a top priority. While AMR and its pilots continue to negotiate, the pilots have said they support a merger with US Airways. They have also said they already have a tentative labor deal in place with US Airways.

-----

It remains unclear whether Marathon supports a standalone restructuring or a US Airways merger, or whether Marathon would be in a position to finance an independent exit from bankruptcy for AMR. But as a large debtholder, the hedge fund could be in a position to influence either scenario by objecting to plans it does not support.
