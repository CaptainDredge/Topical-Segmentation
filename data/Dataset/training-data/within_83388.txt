JPMorgan received court permission in June to pay as much as $44.6 million to resolve private litigation accusing it of conspiring to fix prices and rig bids on municipal bond transactions.

Rebecca Meiklejohn, of the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust division, said at the plea hearing that Wright was expected to testify at the upcoming trial of former UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) executives Gary Heinz, Michael Welty and Peter Ghavami, who were also charged in a bid rigging scheme.
