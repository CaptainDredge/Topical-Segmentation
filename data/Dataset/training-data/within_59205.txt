We will take this up again at the European Council of March 24. "So it was not a discussion on concrete proposals, not at all." ON ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: "The outlook has substantially improved, including in the euro zone countries which were in difficulties recently. "We are aware there is still aware a lot of homework to do, it is not a time for complacency.

We will draw the lessons from the crisis. "We decided to use the momentum to adopt a comprehensive package in March." EU COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUAL BARROSO: ON COMPETITIVENESS: "It is extremely positive that member states are committing to a comprehensive agenda and that they recognize that more convergence is necessary to achieve this higher level of competitiveness." "We are going to complete of course the initiatives that were already taken in terms of governance." "We are ready to go further, namely in the euro area.

But we must increase our competitiveness, and the yardstick or benchmark should be the member state that shows the best practices. "That means we want to commit ourselves to a pact for competitiveness." "What we want to establish is a pact for competitiveness and in so doing we want to make it very clear that we intend to grow together more closely at a political level, which is not to say that there should not be a competition for the best solution among the member states." "Our deadline would be to aim for the March European Council meeting to take the definitive proposals, which is to say that before that council meeting we would have to agree amongst the euro area members and the Eurogroup members on the details of that pact.

"We want to ensure the convergence of different European economies and we have further strengthened our discussions on this matter in the past few weeks. We therefore agree on a structural plan that is designed to respond to the challenges that Europe faces." "This response means more integration of our economic policies, with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of our economies." MERKEL: "Germany and France will make it very obvious that we intend to defend the euro as a currency -- that is only what is to be expected -- but we also want to defend it as a political project." "What we want is to ensure is to safeguard prosperity and wealth for the people in our countries.

"...Before the end of the year we will be able to in very concrete terms furnish proof that we are serious about such a pact." "We want to send out a clear message, that as the European Union, we intend to grow together. What we want to establish is a pact for competitiveness.
