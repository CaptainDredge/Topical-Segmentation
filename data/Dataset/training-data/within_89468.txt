A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statements in its court complaint. Swaminathan instructed Vanguard to buy 6,200 Facebook shares when trading began on May 18, a Friday. She tried to cancel the order after it became clear that Facebook trading would begin later than expected, but Vanguard executed the order, although she made several efforts to follow up on cancellation request, she wrote.

Swaminathan said she remained "trapped" in the stock until Monday morning, when it had declined to "around $8 to $9" per share. It is unclear how much Swaminathan paid per share; the IPO priced the shares at $38 by underwriters. Her $1.9 million claim includes $105,000 for compensatory damages, $500,000 for punitive damages, $1 million for "pain and suffering" and $315,000 in treble damages, which are typically awarded in certain instances of fraud.

Pushback from firms involved in the IPO could leave investors who seek arbitration with only costly, longer court cases as a way to resolve any disputes, Caruso said. Facebook's May 18 debut was marred by trading glitches and confusion. The IPO also became mired in controversy as shareholders, in more than a dozen lawsuits, accused Facebook and its underwriters of obscuring the company's weakened growth forecasts ahead of the stock offering.

Morgan Stanley's main argument for putting a stop to the arbitration is that Swaminathan does not have a retail brokerage account with the firm and "has not engaged in any securities or business dealings with the firm," according to its court complaint. Investors who have brokerage accounts typically agree, when signing account opening documents, to resolve legal disputes in FINRA's forum.

Swaminathan, however, does not have such an agreement with Morgan Stanley, according to the complaint. Swaminathan, who is not represented by a lawyer in the arbitration case and described herself as a retired teacher and widow, put her life savings in the investment, according to her complaint. Morgan Stanley, she said, "informed their own privileged clients" that it was downgrading its outlook on the stock, just before the IPO, and then issued more shares while raising the price "just to suck more suckers into the stock," according to her FINRA complaint filed in July.
