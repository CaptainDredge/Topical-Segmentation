DOLLAR DRIVEN DOWN Many analysts expect the central bank to launch a further round of asset buying at its next meeting on November 2-3. Expectations for further quantitative easing have driven the U.S. dollar to eight-month lows against major currencies. The currencies in emerging economies have risen as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.

Kocherlakota said the main economic effect that a new round of quantitative easing would have is signaling to markets the Fed's commitment to keeping rates lower for longer. But its ability to bring long-term rates closer to near-zero short-term rates would be more "muted" than earlier efforts, he said. Still, he said he had lowered his outlook for growth next year to 2.5 percent from his 3 percent forecast last month and called the unemployment situation "deeply troubling." Plosser said he also expects to lower his growth forecast for 2011, but not for 2012.

"Because I see little gain at this point, and some costs, I would prefer not to engage in further asset purchases at this time." Rosengren said a challenge of unconventional policies is that the benefits are harder to track than the costs. While he said the Fed must try to weigh both benefits and costs, he added: "We cannot take lightly how far off the mark unemployment and inflation seem to be."

Some analysts have suggested the Fed would need to buy $1 trillion to have an impact. "I don't think purchases have to be as large as some market participants think," Rosengren said, after giving a speech in New York titled "How should monetary policy respond to a slow recovery?" Rosengren said his answer to the question posed by his speech was "vigorously, creatively, thoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we have options at our disposal.

"I'd want to see some progress on both our inflation and unemployment objectives," to be convinced no further monetary easing will be needed, Rosengren told Reuters in an interview after his speech. Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser, for his part, said he would only support more asset purchases if expectations of deflation emerge.
