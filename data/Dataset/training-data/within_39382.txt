"It's a report but it is certainly the deal that we expect to be done. It always seemed likely that the outcome would be no change from Japanese settlement," said Mark Pervan, a senior commodities analyst at ANZ. "The mills have started to preempt this move; Baosteel kept its (steel) prices on hold for its main products so they were obviously preparing for this outcome." If confirmed, the deal would mean China's steel sector had conceded to the same price that Japanese and South Korean rivals accepted from Rio and BHP Billiton, but for only half the time, giving China's mills the chance to argue for cheaper rates if a tentative economic recovery that has revived steel prices falters.

The deal, however, will also expose China to a risk of repricing iron ore potentially at higher costs later this year when demand from elsewhere, especially Europe, is set to recover and tighten market conditions, driving up iron ore prices. China, the world's biggest steel producer and buyer of more than half of all traded iron ore, had initially sought a bigger price cut of up to 45 percent versus 2008, but last week softened those demands after the June 30 deadline for agreeing terms lapsed, giving miners the right to suspend term deals.

I have nothing to say about the news," Chen Xianwen, head of the market research department at the China Iron and Steel Association industry body, told Reuters. The Shanghai-based China Business News, backed by a local government agency, said China had agreed to pay $0.97 per dry metric tonne unit for Pilbara blend fines and $1.12 per dmtu for Pilbara Blend lump, but only for April through October.

But some traders said the dention of Rio officials appeared coincidental rather than a bargaining ploy deployed by China, which arrested base metal traders a few years ago over its investigation into an alleged trade scam. China's Foreign Ministry and Shanghai police gave no reasons for the arrests, while a spokesman for China's embassy in Canberra also declined to comment.

It said negotiations were already underway for the following period. But the newspaper said its sources could not say which of the big iron ore suppliers had signed the deal. A 33 percent cut would be in line with what analysts have been expecting as Rio Tinto showed no inclination to relax its "take it or leave it" stance on the initial deal, and an economic recovery lifted spot market prices above new contract levels, leaving China with little leverage.
