It had 14 percent market share in the flash memory market in 2008, the company said in court documents. Spansion said it plans to refocus on its embedded flash memory products which are used in DVD players, digital video recorders and networking routers, intellectual property solutions, and the profitable parts of the wireless segment.

Spansion has 1,800 employees, and 6,100 workers at its foreign subsidiaries, it said in court papers. None of its subsidiaries outside of the United States and Japan have entered court protection, Spansion said. Its Japanese arm filed for bankruptcy protection on February 9 with total liabilities of $810 million, following in the heels of Germany's Qimonda QMNDQ.PK in becoming the latest victim of the global chip sector's downturn.

The company is also exploring proposals from multiple parties seeking a "strategic transaction," it said in a statement. Fujitsu ( 6719.T ) owns about 11.4 percent of Spansion, and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD.N ) owns about 8.7 percent. Spansion, based in Sunnyvale, California, said it can fund expenses and business operations with its current and expected cash resources, but is also in discussions with its debtholders about obtaining debtor-in-possession (DIP) bankruptcy financing.

Spansion said in court documents, that oversupply in the chip market and sharp price drops for its products through 2007 had hurt cash flow from operations in 2007 and early in 2008 it said it lost liquidity due to about $122 million in sour auction-rate security investments. The company experienced a "sharp decline" in demand again in the fourth quarter of 2008, which combined with tight credit market conditions and led to the bankruptcy filing, it said.

Prior to the bankruptcy filing, Spansion said it has consulted with an ad hoc consortium of holders of its $625 million senior secured floating rate notes due 2013 and "continues to be actively engaged in constructive discussions" on a reorganization plan with the consortium that would enable it to emerge more quickly from court protection.
