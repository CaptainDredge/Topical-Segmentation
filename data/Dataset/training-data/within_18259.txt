Icahn, Motorola's second-biggest shareholder, is engaged in a proxy battle with the company, proposing a slate of four directors to the board of the No. 3 phone maker, which has seen its market share plummet in the last year. In a Reuters interview, Icahn declined to confirm the Journal story except to say that he would not be satisfied unless Keith Meister, chief executive of Icahn Enterprises and manager of Icahn's $8 billion fund, became a director.

Icahn said in the complaint filed in Delaware that he and his affiliates had spent more than $2 billion for over 144 million Motorola shares, implying a loss in value of about 30 percent for the investment. SHAREHOLDER SYMPATHY? Motorola, which has said it faces a challenging 2008, has been losing to rivals such as industry leader Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and No. 2-ranked Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) in the last year amid criticism of its cell phone line-up and failure to produce a strong successor to the once-lauded Razr phone.

Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder said Icahn, who failed to win a Motorola board seat last year, was likely looking for information that would help him win shareholder support ahead of the annual meeting, set for May 5. Snyder expects shareholders to be more open to Icahn at this year's director election.

Motorola, which had previously urged shareholders to support its director slate instead of Icahn's candidates, declined comment on whether it had offered to support two Icahn nominees. Motorola shares closed up nearly 5 percent at $9.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares have lost 63 percent of their value since mid-October 2006, when investors started to become disillusioned with its results.
