If they are not going to have implicit government guarantees then we also have to convince the market that they are going to be allowed to fall if they don't behave according to market principles." "We have got a ways to go still. We are working on it and we're doing the best we can." (Reporting by Jan Lopatka and  Michael Winfrey ; Editing by Ron Askew)

I think it could be on the order of $100 billion less than what we had initially thought, but I would leave that up to how the rest of the committee would want." "There's also the issue of tapering so you could sort of slow down the pace (of) the purchases, and that is being debated by the committee." "I think tapering worked fine at the end of the NBS program, so I see no reason why we wouldn't taper this time as well.

That is a complication of this tightening cycle that has not been around in previous tightening cycles." MARKET REACTION TO TIGHTENING "Obviously if you start to reverse, all the effects will go into reverse, but that is just normal tightening of monetary policy. If you start to raise rates, if you start to tighten monetary policy as the economy improves so that you don't get too much inflation in the long run or the medium term."

We are feeding the fire at this moment. We know there is a lot of lag on monetary policy, so we have to start thinking about turning this around in the near future." BULLARD'S PREFERRED PROCESS OF EASING "We're purchasing securities at a rapid rate. If we stop that process and we just let the balance sheet stay at a high level and keep the policy rate near zero, and keep our extended period language, we could pause for a couple of meetings like that.

And then we could start to take other measures to start to reduce the size of the balance sheet, to think about possible language changes with the extended period, to eventually get the policy rate off zero." "That's my preferred sequence." "The balance sheet doesn't have to come all the way back to normal before we can start raising interest rates.
