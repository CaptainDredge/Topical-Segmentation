"With respect to longer-run prospects, however, my own view is more optimistic. As I will discuss, although important problems certainly exist, the growth fundamentals of the United States do not appear to have been permanently altered by the shocks of the past four years. It may take some time, but we can reasonably expect to see a return to growth rates and employment levels consistent with those underlying fundamentals."

JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke delivered a keenly awaited speech to policymakers gathered in the mountains of Wyoming on Friday.Following are some key points of his speech: STIMULUS OPTIONS - Bernanke disappointed investors hoping for a fresh steer on what the Fed might do next to boost the U.S. economy, saying the central bank "has a range of tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus.

"We will continue to consider those and other pertinent issues, including of course economic and financial developments, at our meeting in September, which has been scheduled for two days (the 20th and the 21st) instead of one to allow a fuller discussion," Bernanke said in the speech. "The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability." Economists had not expected Bernanke to announce any major new measures but many had thought he would discuss the options in some detail.

But the scale of the crises in housing and the financial sector meant this recovery had been slower than bounce-banks from most recessions, he said. BERNANKE URGES LAWMAKERS TO ACT ON GROWTH - Bernanke repeated his call on U.S. politicians to take the initiative to help the economy, saying "most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank." While Washington needs to return the United States back to fiscal health, "fiscal policymakers should not, as a consequence, disregard the fragility of the current economic recovery." That could add to criticism of Bernanke from within the Republican party which has blocked further stimulus by the Obama administration.

His speech fell short of those expectations. BIG CONCERN ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT - Bernanke said inflation did not pose a threat and the real problem facing the U.S. economy was its "extraordinarily high" level of long-term unemployment. Those comments seemed to underscore the Fed's commitment to ensuring the recovery does not peter out.
