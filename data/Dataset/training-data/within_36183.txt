COMMENTARY: YOUSSEF SQUALI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, JEFFERIES & CO. "Good quarter considering the environment. Cost containment, including capex, was pretty impressive, which is what's needed to make the stock work short-term." MARTIN PYYKKONEN, SENIOR ANALYST, WUNDERLICH SECURITIES "Kind of a relief rally to some. "In one sense, revenue was certainly not robust, but considering the environment people are obviously taking that as somewhat of a comfort that it wasn't any worse." "Tougher times but better discipline within the company on the cost management side (meant) that they were still able to come in and beat the bottom line pretty nicely by a few percentage points." "Seventeen percent paid-click volume growth was actually pretty good, but makes you wonder why the revenue number wasn't a little bit higher." RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH "The numbers are better than expected, especially with respect to the earnings per share number.

And they beat on the bottom line. "You can tell that the new CFO is having an impact in terms of cutting back on expenses and realigning the operating expenses and cost structure with the lower revenue run-rate. "Search volume is strong and that's translating into growth that they're seeing on the paid-click side.

Revenues were in line with the street consensus and EPS beat. They took market share. "Economically speaking, I think Q1 is the most challenging quarter, so the momentum should continue for the rest of the year."

So consumers are still shopping. If anything, they're shopping more vigorously online for bargains and that's helping them offset some of the weaknesses in the search-ad budgets." SAMEET SINHA, SENIOR ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES "There will be challenges but I think we've seen strength both domestically and in Europe. "As advertisers are getting better control of their budget and a better understanding of their business under these macro conditions, they are taking money away from newspaper and television and going back online to advertise, and Google gets a disproportionate part of the market." JASON AVILIO, ANALYST, KAUFMAN BROS "It was a good quarter.

The earnings are still increasing so that's a big positive." RICHARD FETYKO, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MERRIMAN CURHAN FORD "It looks pretty good. Revenues are in line, which I think will actually positively surprise people, because I think there was a lot of caution going into the quarter that perhaps revenue could be below consensus.
