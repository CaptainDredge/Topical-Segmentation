Shares of the fourth-largest investment bank fell to $23.75, their lowest close since October 2002. The Financial Times said on Wednesday that Lehman had sought capital from Korean financial institutions, and may still enter a deal with them later this year. Lehman said on Monday it expected to post a roughly $2.8 billion quarterly loss next week.

Over the last week, more than a dozen clients, dealers and banks told Reuters they were trading normally with Lehman, but two funds said they had reduced their exposure. Investment banks are much less likely to crash now that they can borrow funds from the U.S. Federal Reserve, an option unavailable to Bear Stearns, analysts said.

The cost of protecting Lehman's debt against default in the credit derivatives market rose about 30 basis points on Wednesday to 283 basis points, or $283,000 a year for five years for every $10 million of debt protected, according to Markit. That figure was about 465 basis points in mid-March. (Additional reporting by  Karen Brettell  in New York and Muralikumar Anantharaman in Boston; Editing by Dave Zimmerman and  Braden Reddall )

Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) shares slipped 2.9 percent to $162.40, and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N fell 6.6 percent to $35.46. Lehman is taking steps to scale down its risk. It decreased assets by about $130 billion in the second quarter, and has raised $10 billion of common equity and equity-linked capital in recent months.

Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), the biggest publicly traded U.S. money management firm, told CNBC on Wednesday, "Lehman is not a Bear Stearns situation." BlackRock bought Lehman shares earlier this week. "Lehman Brothers is adequately structured in terms of avoiding a liquidity crisis. That was what the Bear Stearns problem was," Fink said.
