"This opportunistic acquisition takes place on the heels of BofA's recent July 1 acquisition of troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp," S&P said in a statement. "In our view, the purchase of Merrill will place further pressure on BofA's capital, already strained by the Countrywide acquisition," S&P added. S&P cut Bank of America's counterparty credit rating one notch to "AA-minus," the fourth highest investment grade, from "AA." It rates Merrill Lynch "A," the sixth highest investment grade.
