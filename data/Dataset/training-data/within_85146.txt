The Taiwanese company's chairman, Terry Gou, visits Japan this week, with a joint statement on the progress of talks by the two companies slated for Friday. TOUGH TIMES Times are already tough in Yaita. Shuttered stores blight shopping streets devoid of any major retail or restaurant chain outlets. Few new buildings freshen up the worn 1970s architecture of its town centre.

Endo, however, isn't going to try and stop Sharp from walking away. Beyond Yaita, unions more focused on winning big severance package than keeping jobs are also unlikely to stand in Sharp's way. Hammered by the same market-grabbing tactics it once used so successfully and a persistently strong yen that drags on its competitiveness, Yaita's mayor says he feels pity rather than anger towards Sharp, which in the year to March 31 posted a record net loss of 376 billion yen ($4.78 billion).

HOLLOWING OUT Century-old Sharp is not the only company suffering in Japan's once unstoppable industrial heartland. In an echo of the earlier experience of manufacturing towns in U.S. "rust belt" states like Michigan or Ohio, ballooning losses and stretched finances at component fabricators and consumer electronics makers, and the plant closures that follow, are becoming more widespread, making once-rare large scale lay-offs common.

The value of chips, televisions and liquid crystal displays churned out by Japanese factories is shrinking. In 2011 it totaled 13 trillion yen worth of goods, according to Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association. That figure compares with 20 trillion yen in 2006 and 26 trillion yen in 2000. SHRINKING WORKFORCE Membership in the Japanese Electrical, Electronic and Information union, the largest of the umbrella labor groups representing workers at Sharp, Sony and other companies, has fallen from a peak of 800,000 reached 15 years ago to 600,000, according to Masashi Okamato a senior official at its headquarters in Tokyo.

Close to the plant, at a small eatery selling Chinese-style noodles and fried dumplings, the proprietor, Norio Innami, 62, shrugs his shoulders. "There isn't much we can do about it," says Innami, who estimates that Sharp workers who come in at lunchtime account for a 10th of his business. "It'll probably end up closed, and Sharp will probably end up being owned by the Taiwanese."
