"The point they're trying to persuade the judge of is that this is so beyond unreasonable, it is ridiculous and perhaps even reckless or intentional," Judy said. The August 31 court filing reiterated the government's long-held position that BP committed gross negligence, a position that could nearly quadruple civil damages under the Clean Water Act to $21 billion if a federal judge agrees.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - In accusing BP Plc of gross negligence and willful misconduct over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the U.S. Justice Department has shown that it is prepared for a bruising court struggle with the London-based oil giant.Government lawyers used unusually blunt language in describing the conduct of BP and its executives in a court filing on Friday, saying that it "would not be tolerated in a middling size company manufacturing dry goods for sale in a suburban mall." While settlement talks are still possible, and some saw political overtones to the timing of the Justice Department's statements ahead of this week's Democratic National Convention, most legal experts said the stinging accusations suggested that the government felt it could win a case in front of a jury and make BP suffer.

While not introducing any new facts, the 39-page brief was sprinkled with tart language about what it called BP's "cherry-picked assertions" and "culture of corporate recklessness." It accused Transocean Ltd of gross negligence, too. A Transocean spokesman declined to comment. "I read it as the government being profoundly confident in the merits of its case, a confidence that they will ultimately prevail in a finding of gross negligence," said Blaine LeCesne, a law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans.

The government's brief got the attention of analysts at the financial services firm Raymond James & Associates, which said its timing was meant to make an impact before the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. "After several quiet months on the legal front, the DOJ is getting busy again, and the political overtones seem readily apparent," the analysts wrote.

LeCesne said the Justice Department's filing firmly signals that it is ready for trial. "The lines have been drawn, and they are preparing for battle," LeCesne said. "Unless there is a significant about-face in BP's perspective this case is going to trial." The filing comes more than two years after the disaster that struck on April 20, 2010 when a surge of methane gas known to rig hands as a "kick" sparked an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig as it was drilling the mile-deep Macondo 252 well off Louisiana's coast.
