"In that case, I am afraid we will have to reject the candidate. We will be doing so for the Japanese people." "In that scenario, people may worry about leaving the position vacant. But we have already approved Shirakawa as a deputy governor. I think it is desirable for a deputy governor to serve as acting governor under the current BOJ law." "We don't want to leave it vacant.

Parliament's lower house, controlled by the ruling coalition, approved the government's choice for the top job, Deputy BOJ Governor Toshiro Muto, on Thursday along with retired central bank official Masaaki Shirakawa and academic Takatoshi Ito as deputies. But coming after the upper house's rejection of Muto and Ito on Wednesday, the vote simply confirmed a political impasse over the central bank's leadership.

But if we ended up having that situation, we should move on within the framework of the BOJ law. Experts overseas have told me that markets will be OK. So I don't think that will lead to any big confusion. Even so, we should not leave the position vacant for long, so I strongly hope for a candidate that we can approve and resolve the issue." "It is beyond the realm of possibility that our party will approve a person who we rejected once." CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY NOBUTAKA MACHIMURA, March 14, at a news conference: "The prime minister will consider the BOJ selection carefully as he knows that a (policy) vacuum cannot be created."

"We also agreed to ask the government to put forward a new candidate by March 17." He quoted Oshima as saying a change in the BOJ Law may be proposed.

PRIME MINISTER YASUO FUKUDA, March 13, speaking to reporters: "It is not good to be unable to reach a decision on the BOJ leadership when there are issues such as currency moves." Asked how he will deal with the political row and whether the government will pick a new nominee for BOJ chief: "I did not have much time to think about it as I was attending the budget committee and plenary session of parliament today, but I have time until the end of this week so I would like to think about it thoroughly.
