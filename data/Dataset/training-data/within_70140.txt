As for the ECB itself, while it has baulked at directly intervening to bolster the EFSF under outgoing President Jean-Claude Trichet, that could change from November when he will be replaced by Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy. The arrival of self-styled "pragmatist" Joerg Asmussen as Germany's candidate to replace the hawkish Juergen Stark on the six-man committee that runs the ECB day-to-day, plus the expected arrival of another Frenchman to numerically replace Trichet, could also incline it toward a more flexible approach.

Their position has not changed," one European diplomat from a nation sympathetic to Paris's view said on Sunday. Eurogroup chair Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, acknowledged the diplomatic stalemate over the crisis was damaging for Europe: "The outside impression is disastrous." In an attempt to lay the issue to rest, German officials have said that only two options for leveraging the EFSF remained on the table ahead of Wednesday's self-declared deadline.

The first involves using the EFSF to guarantee a share of losses on at-risk euro zone bonds, allowing it reinforce investors' confidence while maximizing its resources. The second is bolstering its firepower via a Special Purpose Vehicle capitalized by donors such as China or Brazil. The prospect of allowing foreign nations to decide the fate of Europe has alarmed the Europe Commission, and this option appears unlikely to win through, not least because of the implications it has for European sovereignty.

Paris -- with support from most of the 17 euro zone states, including Italy and Spain -- argues the European Financial Stability Fund should be given a banking license, allowing the fund to leverage its lending capacity by tapping almost unlimited credit from the ECB's lending window. Germany, fiercely protective of the independence of the Frankfurt-based ECB, has argued that using it to leverage the EFSF would violate its mandate, leading to an unusually public disagreement between the two powers which normally chart the course for the bloc.
