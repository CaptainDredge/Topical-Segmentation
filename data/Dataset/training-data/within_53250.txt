The probe also examined a sexual harassment claim, but found it lacked merit. [ID:nN12143846] Michael Holston, Hewlett-Packard's general counsel, concluded that Hurd had demonstrated a "profound lack of judgment that seriously undermined his credibility." The Palo Alto, California-based company's market value has fallen about $14.4 billion since Hurd's resignation was announced after the August 6 stock market close, including about $8.6 billion on Monday alone, Reuters data show.

"HP lost significant credibility," according to the lawsuit by the Brockton Contributory Retirement System, filed Tuesday in the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California. Hurd resigned as chairman and chief executive after the investigation found that he had allegedly falsified expense reports to cover a relationship with a female marketing consultant.
