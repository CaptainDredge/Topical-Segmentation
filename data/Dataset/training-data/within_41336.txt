At the time, Geithner was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and was instrumental in crafting the AIG bailout. The request also included that Geithner define the fiduciary responsibilities of the AIG trustees and what it means for them to act in "the best interests of the Treasury," along with records and communications relating to the selection of the trustees and plans to prevent violations of securities laws.

This raises a troubling and urgent question: Who can the American taxpayers hold accountable if the trustees make a decision that is not in their best interest?" Issa, of California, and Bachus, of Alabama, said that if the AIG trust were to be the model for management of the government's shares in Citigroup and other bailed out companies, "the American people have a right to know how these trusts are going to be designed, how they will operate and how the trustees can be held accountable." The AIG trust protects the trustees from personal liability so long as they act lawfully and "in the best interests of the Treasury." The two lawmakers also sent a request to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, asking for a full and complete explanation of his decision not to let AIG enter bankruptcy in September 2008.

Rep. Darrell Issa, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Rep. Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, sent the audit request to Neil Barofsky, inspector general for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. They said the lack of transparency and accountability in the AIG trust was relevant if Treasury moves forward with a similar trust agreement for its interest in Citigroup, another financial institution with extraordinary government support.

"It is not clear how the American people can hold the AIG trustees accountable for their actions," wrote Issa and Bachus. "While the trustees have the discretion to exercise full control over AIG, since the American taxpayers own nearly 80 percent of its shares, the trustees cannot be fired if their decisions conflict with the preferences of government officials.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Two prominent Republican congressmen on Monday said trustees for the government's stake in American International Group lacked accountability and requested an audit of the arrangements by the U.S. bailout inspector general.After AIG was bailed out last year with about $180 billion in U.S. taxpayer support, a three-member trust was created to manage and eventually dispose of the government's effective 80 percent stake in the insurance giant.
