Other estimates put the amount even higher, with the Los Angeles Times estimating his payout at more than $110 million, including health benefits for life for him and his wife, and "gross-up" payments to cover his taxes. Early in the housing downturn, Mozilo said Countrywide would take advantage of the situation by expanding its market position.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - In the early days of Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, competitors underestimated Angelo Mozilo, the mortgage lender's founder.Mozilo, born in 1938, the son of Italian immigrants, recalled decades later how some in the white patrician world of mortgage banking judged him disparagingly because of his dark brown skin.

Unmentioned by Mozilo were the industry's loose lending policies and mortgage products such as "liar loans," which gave borrowers money at higher rates without verifying their income. But last April, in a speech in Beverly Hills, California, Mozilo conceded Countrywide lost its compass and chased risky customers as competition in that market increased.

Names like Ameriquest, New Century, NovaStar Financial and Ownit Mortgage Solutions set a new lowered standard, changing the rules of the game, Mozilo said. "Traditional lenders such as ourselves looked around and said, 'Well maybe there's a (new) paradigm here,'" Mozilo said. "'Maybe we've just been wrong. Maybe you can originate these loans safely without verifications, without documentation,'" Mozilo said.

But through grit and hustle, Mozilo, the son of a Bronx butcher, built Countrywide into the largest mortgage lender in the United States. Mozilo founded Countrywide in 1969 and became one of corporate America's top-paid executives. Mozilo received about $387 million from pay and stock option gains from 2002 to 2006, U.S. regulatory filings show.
