"There are many ways to address the consumer market and RIM ... needs to go after consumers," said Duncan Stewart, an analyst at DSAM Consulting in Toronto. The company has stacked its product line-up with consumer friendly handsets like the Storm and the BlackBerry Pearl and loaded them up with multimedia features like photo management software and music players.

Stewart added he would be "stunned" if RIM chose not to build on the sales momentum of the Storm and roll out another touchscreen device. At the same time, the Waterloo, Ontario-based company has been careful to remain faithful and responsive to the executives, politicians, lawyers and other professional clients who have been its mainstay.

Last month, RIM offered a rosy outlook that signaled further growth, despite the global economic slowdown. Analysts had previously said companies could cut their telecom budgets and consumers could tighten their purse strings amid the recession, which could spell slower sales for RIM. This has failed to materialize as the company's results last month topped analyst expectations.

Balsillie said Storm sales remain strong and added "we have next-generation devices with that and the whole roadmap." Success of individual handsets is crucial to RIM, especially as it pushes deeper into the retail market, where consumer tastes can be fickle. The potential market is huge. After all, every mobile phone user can theoretically be turned into a smartphone user.

Retail is also a good way for RIM to diversify its user base. The latest data shows RIM is doing well: market research firm NPD Group reported on Monday that the company's BlackBerry Curve moved past the iPhone to become the best-selling consumer smartphone in the U.S. in the first quarter.
