LISBON  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings cut Portugal's sovereign credit rating by one notch to AA- on Wednesday, citing budgetary underperformance in 2009 and warning that a similar outcome this year and next could cause another downgrade.The change underlined concerns that the debt troubles that have afflicted Greece will move to other of the euro zone's weaker economies, and it drove European stocks and an already battered single currency lower.

Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos warned on Tuesday that without the political consensus, the programme would have no purpose and fears about Portugal's ability to finance itself will persist. Although Fitch said the programme was credible, it saw a "significant" risk of macroeconomic disappointment with knock-on effects for the deficit particularly in 2012-2013.

"It is fundamental that Portugal show a firm political effort in implementing its growth and stability programme, with a view to correcting public finances and reducing the foreign deficit through increased competitiveness," the finance ministry said in an email to Reuters. The leader of the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, was meeting members of parliament from her party on Wednesday to discuss the programme.

The premium Portugal has to pay on its bonds compared to German Bunds briefly hit a high of 129 basis points after the announcement but then began to tighten again, and analysts said the move had been well-flagged by Fitch and still left the rating comparable with other agencies. Fitch also said the government's long-term budget austerity plan was broadly credible and it did not expect political instability to upset the passage of the necessary legislation.

Fitch's AA- rating is now comparable with Moody's Aa2 rating and both are above S&P's A+. In any case, the rating remains in Fitch's "very high quality" range. "The market is taking it very well. AA- is still respectable credit and bears no comparison with Greece," said Kenneth Broux, an economist at Lloyds TSB.
