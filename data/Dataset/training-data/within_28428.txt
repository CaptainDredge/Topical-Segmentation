"Commodity-based countries will be worse off than most others." Fears of a global economic downturn have already slashed oil prices by more than half from their highs of over $140 a barrel earlier this year. Crude was trading around $68 a barrel on Monday, recovering from last week's lows. Members of the OPEC oil producers group agreed last month to reduce output by 1.5 million barrels a day, or 5 percent, from November 1 in an effort to shore up prices.
