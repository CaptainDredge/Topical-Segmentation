NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp CEO Kenneth Lewis was pressured by senior federal officials Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke to accept a merger with troubled Merrill Lynch & Co or lose his job, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday.In a letter to senior members of congressional committees and the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Cuomo said Lewis met then U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in Washington in mid-December.

Cuomo said that, in an interview, Paulson "largely corroborated" Lewis's account. "Secretary Paulson's threat swayed Lewis," Cuomo said. The letter also stated that Paulson "has informed us that he made the threat at the request of Chairman Bernanke." Researcher Beth Young of the Corporate Library corporate governance research group said if the government wanted influence it needed to be transparent about it.

Lewis testified in a probe by Cuomo that Paulson wanted the Merrill acquisition to go through "to stem a financial disaster in the financial markets." He also testified that Paulson and Bernanke pressured him to keep quiet about losses at Merrill, which rose to $12 billion from $9 billion in a matter of days in December.

Cuomo said the SEC, which is charged with protecting investor interests, "appears to have been kept in the dark" about talks between the banks and federal officials that followed. "During those meetings, the federal government officials pressured Bank of America not to seek to rescind the merger agreement," Cuomo wrote. "We do not yet have a complete picture of the Federal Reserve's role in these matters because the Federal Reserve has invoked the bank examination privilege." A spokesman for Paulson said on Thursday that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve believed there was no reasonable legal basis for Bank of America to terminate the Merrill deal.

Cuomo, who released testimony by Lewis, said his office uncovered details during a probe into the circumstances of $3.6 billion of bonuses paid to Merrill executives before the completion of the Bank of America takeover on January 1. "As you will see, while the investigation initially focused on huge fourth quarter bonus payouts, we have uncovered facts that raise questions about the transparency of the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program), as well as about corporate governance and disclosure practices at Bank of America," Cuomo wrote.
