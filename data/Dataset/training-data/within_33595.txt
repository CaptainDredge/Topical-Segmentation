An inflation target is seen by some policy-makers as an important took in achieving stable prices. Instead, for the first time, the Fed issued long-range projections that offered a signal on how it expects the economy to perform beyond its normal three-year forecast horizon. The projections in the minutes of the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee showed officials thought inflation would remain abnormally low through 2010 and possibly into 2011.

Some FOMC members thought establishing targets for growth of the money supply could provide useful information and help anchor inflation expectations. Bernanke dismissed worries that expanding the Fed's balance sheet would stoke inflation, pointing out that with global economic activity so weak and commodity prices low, there was little risk of unacceptably high inflation in the near term.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers largely gave up hope for economic growth in 2009 and discussed setting an inflation target last month as a deepening recession heightened fears of a dangerous decline in prices.With employment falling, the housing market showing no sign of stabilization, and credit conditions still tight despite official interest rates being cut to close to zero, the central bank projected the economy would shrink by between 0.5 percent and 1.3 percent this year, the Fed said in minutes of its January 27-28 policy meeting released on Wednesday.

Bernanke on Wednesday disclosed no new programs to aid the economy. Nor did he mention buying longer-dated Treasury debt, which he discussed in January as a way to ease borrowing costs but has made no public mention of since. Some observers think the Fed is backing off the idea. There was scant discussion of that option in the minutes even though the Fed said after the meeting it was prepared to buy Treasuries if it thought it would be "particularly effective" to loosen up private credit markets while its target for overnight rates are in a zero to 0.25 percent range.

Their longer-run projection called for inflation of 1.7 percent to 2 percent, well above the 2009 forecast for 0.3 percent to 1 percent and an indication of the inflation rate officials would like to achieve. "The longer-term projections of inflation may be interpreted ... as the rate of inflation that FOMC participants see as most consistent with the dual mandate given to it by Congress -- that is the rate of inflation that promotes maximum sustainable employment while also delivering reasonable price stability," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told the National Press Club.
