"There is no doubt with the industry profits coming down, valuations have got a little better, become more interesting at least for a buyer." But if markets continue to firm, this situation may not last for long, prompting consolidators to move in on targets quickly before valuations recover. "There is a lot of hope that if the market continues to go up, then the valuations must go up," said Justin Ong, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers' Asia Pacific wealth management practice.

"There could be a major transformational buy for us," he said in Geneva. CRITICAL MASS Spiraling regulatory requirements and costs springing from clients demands for improved transparency means banks could be forced to take on entirely new support teams and develop new technology, private bankers said. Add this to clients' demands for more contact time to explain what advisers are doing with their hard-earned money, and cost pressures could become too great for some banks, forcing them to seek the infrastructure of larger rivals by selling up.

"Competition is tougher, regulation is another important factor. You need to have an infrastructure to allow you to participate in today's environment," said Felipe Godard, JP Morgan Private Bank ( JPM.N ) managing director and head of European International Markets.

This would only require a 10 percent increase in the bank's current staff of around 90, Reyl said, suggesting economies of scale were a factor in the bank's drive for acquisitions.

"Small banks managing sub-500 million Swiss francs -- which clearly lack the scale -- these are good acquisition targets for us."

Large players at the Reuters Wealth Management Summit suggested private banks needed a critical mass of about $10 billion in assets to be competitive. "Probably if you are below 10 billion, either you buy another bank or you sell," said Guillaume Lejoindre, managing director of SG Private Banking (Suisse) SA. Reyl & Cies Chief Executive Francois Reyl said the threshold depended on the specific kind of business of a private bank, but added that his Swiss private bank was in several discussions for possible acquisitions and aimed to double its size from 2.5 billion Swiss francs in assets under management by 2012.
