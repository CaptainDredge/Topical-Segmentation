Wal-Mart's U.S. stores rang up $239.53 billion in sales last year and Sanford C. Bernstein retail analyst Uta Werner said in a research note that any Marketside roll-out "would be only modestly incremental to the company's results." But Wal-Mart is taking steps now to protect its future market share, analysts said.

Grocery store rivals have already opened smaller outlets to woo U.S. shoppers who want ready-to-eat meals or fresh produce, but who do not have time for a trip to a supermarket. British grocer Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) has opened Fresh & Easy stores in California, Nevada and Arizona, while Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) and Supervalu Inc ( SVU.N ) are testing small stores.

But that can pose a challenge to profits. "If you're small, cheap and convenient, and actually have some good food, you're going to do really well," Bishop said. "The only caveat is not all retailers can do all retailing and Wal-Mart is an exceptional retailer at bringing every day low price and high volume through big stores." FORMAT OF THE FUTURE?

On Tuesday, Tesco said Fresh & Easy recorded a loss of 60 million pounds ($106.58 million) in the first half and sales of 76 million pounds ($135 million). "The dilemma for Wal-Mart is that it's virtually impossible for these stores to be as profitable as their big stores because the mix of products isn't there," Bishop said.

Marketside's website says it is designed "with the quick grocery trip in mind." It will sell prepared meals, like steak fajitas with onions and rice for $6 and a family-sized lasagna for $8, alongside produce, poultry and shampoo. In addition to prepared food like single-serve salads and sandwiches that sell for around $4 and beef lasagna that serves three for $5, Fresh & Easy stores also sell fresh produce, dairy goods, cereal, frozen food, beer and wine, and personal-care items such as toothpaste and deodorant.
