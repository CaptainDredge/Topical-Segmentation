German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italy's Mario Monti and Papademos all voiced optimism about an accord during a three-way conference call, Monti's office said in a statement. The Greek premier also spoke to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and state television said he would pursue talks with euro zone partners "to create a positive mood in view of Monday's meeting and to dispel doubts that could thwart this agreement."
