Our opinion indicated that Lehman's financial statements for that year were fairly presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and we remain of that view." A lawyer for Callan declined to comment, and attorneys for Lowitt and O'Meara were not immediately available. Questions about Lehman's accounting had been raised in the months before its bankruptcy, notably by hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who thought the bank was not taking proper write-downs.

On September 11, for example, J.P. Morgan executives met and decided that the collateral Lehman had posted "was not worth nearly what Lehman claimed it was worth," the report says. The next day, J.P. Morgan asked for an additional $5 billion in collateral. About that time, J.P. Morgan discovered that one of the securities posted by Lehman, an asset-backed security known as Fenway, was "worth practically nothing as collateral." In the report, the examiner raised questions about whether JPMorgan had acted "in good faith" but also detailed an interview in which Dimon said he told Fuld in every conversation "that he did not want to harm Lehman." The examiner found Lehman could have potential claims against JPMorgan, which is still holding about $6.9 billion of Lehman's collateral, and Citi in connection with collateral demands and guaranty agreements in Lehman's final days that hurt its liquidity.

The examiner's report could provide ammunition for future lawsuits that would let Lehman recover more funds for creditors. Lehman's lead bankruptcy attorney, Harvey Miller, said in court on Thursday that the unsealing of the report came at an "opportune time" as the company is in the process of coming up with a reorganization plan that will detail how the bank will complete its bankruptcy.

The examiner said that while some of Lehman's management's decisions "can be questioned in retrospect" and the firm's valuation procedures for its assets "may have been wanting," those responsible for the firm had used their business judgment and were largely not liable for the firm's collapse. However, he said that Lehman, which is now liquidating for the benefit of creditors, could have claims against former Lehman chief executive Dick Fuld and chief financial officers Chris O'Meara, Erin Callan and Ian Lowitt for negligence or breach of fiduciary duty.
