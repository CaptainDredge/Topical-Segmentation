"Toyota's bad numbers make it stand out compared with Honda. However, the whole industry is facing excess capacity and declining sales.

Following are initial reactions from analysts and investors: KATSUHIKO HIROSHIGE, GENERAL MANAGER, EQUITIES TRADING, BANSEI SECURITIES "The forecasts are bad and may spark selling of Toyota shares initially on Monday.

"Amid emerging signs of a recovery in economic indicators recently, the stock market has become quite immune to bad news and has focused increasingly on the time of recovery.

"Some stock market players may shrug off Toyota's forecasts as overly conservative, believing in the prospects of economic recovery." TSUYOSHI MOCHIMARU, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL "Toyota's sales volume projections look a little overly pessimistic, but given that its operating loss forecast is larger than expected, you cannot expect a profit this fiscal year.

"It is possible that their sales projections do not take into account Japanese government stimulus, so we may see an upward revision there. However, that does not mean Toyota will swing into the black." KOICHI OGAWA, CHIEF PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DAIWA SB INVESTMENTS "The actual results aren't so bad but the forecast was bad, very bad.

"By 2010 cost cutting and capacity reduction may be taking effect, so they could break even then. But it looks as if this year will probably be in the red." NAOKI FUJIWARA, FUND MANAGER, SHINKIN ASSET MANAGEMENT "My first impression is bad. Toyota's outlook was worse than I had expected. The company expects a really tough time for the first six months.
