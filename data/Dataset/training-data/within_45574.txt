CORPORATE LOSERS Arguably, helping creditors of bankrupt retailers, such as clothing suppliers, has some social benefit.

Claiming the money does not mean the companies will get it. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has already indicated that it believes it and not the liquidating estate should get Downey Financial's refund.

If Washington Mutual gets the extra refund, the company could have enough money to pay off creditors and have some left over for preferred shareholders, even those who just bought the common or preferred stock.
