SAUDI DEPUTY OIL MINISTER PRINCE ABDULAZIZ BIN SALMAN (ON  AL ARABIYA TV): "The kingdom provides petroleum to meet the needs of customers... It is a commercial decision not a political decision." "Increased production comes in parallel with demand Aramco receives... It is a commercial decision independent of what will be discussed at this meeting." LIBYA CHAIRMAN OF NATIONAL OIL CORP SHOKRI GHANEM (IN LIBYA) "You can't get any decision on important matters in the energy market in a meeting of three hours." "There's oversupply in the market.
