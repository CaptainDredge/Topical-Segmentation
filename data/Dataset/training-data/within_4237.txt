But a group of 13 hedge funds, which collectively hold 19 million shares, or about 30 percent, are fighting the plan, contending Northwest's equity has value despite the company's assertions to the contrary. The funds include such powerhouses as Citadel Investment Corp., Marathon Asset Management, Sandell Asset Management and Owl Creek Asset Management, the lead fund, according to court documents.

The funds argue that this information is a trade secret and irrelevant to the case. But some see a larger plan by debtors and those that advise them. "They are trying to chill the activism of the hedge funds," said Seward & Kissel's Ashmead, who isn't representing the hedge funds in this case.

They also say they provide much-needed liquidity for investors less willing to assert these rights. "It was easier to reach an agreement ten to 15 years ago," said bankruptcy lawyer John Ashmead of Seward & Kissel, who has represented hedge funds in cases including Federal-Mogul Corp. FDMLQ.OB, Mirant Corp. MIR.N, Refco Inc.

SLUGGISH PROCESS "It is sometimes hard to know who are these creditors and what their interests are," said Harvey Miller, a prominent bankruptcy lawyer and Greenhill & Co. ( GHL.N ) vice chairman. "They are creditors with multiple personalities. They use rights in one position to benefit their holdings in another." But hedge funds argue that they are only asserting legal ownership rights in a sluggish process that is often weighted in favor of the bankrupt company.
