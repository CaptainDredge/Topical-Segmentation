The choice will be harder for House Republicans, whose votes will be needed at the start of the process. House Speaker John Boehner probably would need to cobble together a coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats to get it passed. At this point, it is not clear how many votes Boehner can rely on from his side, a Republican aide said, as anything that bears McConnell's name might have trouble passing.

"What McConnell is doing is basically giving up." Such rhetoric carries less weight in the Senate. Tea Party activists arguably prevented Republicans from winning control of that chamber in last year's congressional elections by forcing the party to back inexperienced, erratic candidates over more electable choices in several races. MR. REPUBLICAN, NOT MR.

Obama could also turn the situation to his advantage. "Obama's answer (could be) that Republicans in Congress didn't step up and deal with this so I'm making the tough decisions and showing leadership," said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report. The Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to pass the McConnell measure if it comes up for a vote this week, but prospects are less certain in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Ironically, Democrats who originally opposed spending cuts are now seeking to attach them to the McConnell plan to gain some political cover. The plan could force many Senate Democrats to make an awkward choice -- vote against the wishes of their president or vote for an unpopular debt-ceiling increase, Duffy said.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senator Mitch McConnell's plan to avert an imminent debt default could lead to a day of reckoning for his Republicans as they weigh the prospect of fiscal disaster against the demands of Tea Party activists.With other efforts to raise the federal government's debt ceiling at a standstill, McConnell's "Plan B" to avoid default is increasingly seen as "Plan A" in Washington.
