Many observers expect a competing bid to involve a Chinese entity such as Sinochem, which has hired two investment banks to advise it on options. The case is Potash Corp v. BHP Billiton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, No. 1:10-cv-06024.

"The injunction is designed to stop the deal until the truth comes out," one source said. "The suit is to enjoin future and further violations of the law, not to actually make sure there is no offer." Potash Corp has asked the court to resolve the litigation before the November 18 deadline on BHP's bid, the source said.

At $39 billion, or $130 a share, BHP's current offer allows it to avoid a vote that could scupper a deal. Before bidding for Potash Corp, BHP was focused on building the huge Jansen potash project in Saskatchewan. Slated to begin production around 2015, Jansen has the potential to rank as the world's largest potash mine.

It also accuses BHP of fraud related to the offer. BHP said the suit lacked merit and vowed to defend itself. In a statement, the Anglo-Australian mining company also said it believes the suit won't delay the takeover process. "This lawsuit seems to be their answer to the absence of another bidder emerging, and it's surprising that they would try to deprive their shareholders of the only offer on the table," said a BHP spokesperson who spoke on the condition that he not be identified by name.

The suit claims BHP sought to drive down the Canadian company's perceived value by trumpeting its own plans to enter the potash business. That way, the suit argues, BHP could eventually make a bid for Potash Corp at a low enough price to avoid triggering a BHP shareholder vote. Under British law, a shareholder vote is required if a company attempts a takeover that exceeds 25 percent of its own market valuation.
