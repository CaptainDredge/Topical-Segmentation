New York and Delaware sought permission last year to intervene in the case and raised questions about the "fairness and adequacy" of the proposed settlement. Schneiderman claimed investors would receive only pennies on the dollar for losses suffered. He also maintained at one time that Bank of New York Mellon had a conflict of interest because it stood to receive financial benefits under the settlement.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Gregory Strong, deputy attorney general for the Delaware Department of Justice, said in a joint filing on Friday they were still not endorsing the settlement. The attorneys general were not expressing a view about the settlement's "adequacy or the reasonableness or propriety of the trustee's or any other party's conduct," they said.

BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), Metlife Inc ( MET.N ) and Allianz SE's ( ALVG.DE ) Pacific Investment Management Co were among the investors who signed onto the accord, which affected all certificate holders in the trusts. A hearing is scheduled to begin on May 30 in New York state court on whether the settlement should be approved.

The bank maintains it has always fulfilled its duties as trustee. The FHFA oversees mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which back about half the existing U.S. home loans. The enterprises were seized by the government in 2008 as mortgage losses mounted. The case is In re: Bank of New York Mellon, New York State Supreme Court, New York County No. 651786/2011.

At one point, Schneiderman brought fraud counterclaims against Bank of New York Mellon, but those claims were dropped last year. In Friday's filing, the attorneys general said the "adversarial proceeding might have been avoided had the trustee provided notice to all certificate holders at an earlier point in the settlement negotiation process." Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, declined comment.
