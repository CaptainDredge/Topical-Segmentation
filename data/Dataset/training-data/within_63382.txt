This ability to step back would be an asset to the CFTC. "I think there are some people that think Mark leaves this job with ... preconceived decisions, or he's a defender or something. He's not," David Krone, Reid's chief of staff, told Reuters. "His job was to be able to present to the leader his best estimation about what might be happening, and what the affects of a certain provision or language" might be.

This could lead to a few tricky months as speculation mounts about his views. Already, some industry lobbyists are questioning his grip on the regulatory agenda. "He probably doesn't have any significant amount of knowledge about these issues. If he did, I think we would know more about what positions he's likely to take," said a source who lobbies on behalf of the financial industry and follows CFTC rulemaking closely.

Holifield said Wetjen played the role of a trouble-shooter through Dodd-Frank, helping to iron-out differences between Senate committees, or even the House and the Senate, by giving advice, all with Reid's views in mind. At one point, as the Senate Banking and Agricultural committees were merging their bills, Wetjen was there for every meeting, including weekends, during a two-week stretch.

"He's a very curious guy. Whenever he pings me to go to lunch, I know to block out three hours," said David LaPlante, a senior vice president at consulting company One to One Interactive. The two met years ago when Wetjen, who was freelancing for magazines in Nevada, wrote a profile of LaPlante.

While that process will have given the little-known former lawyer an unparalleled view of the reforms that will overhaul the swaps market, Wetjen has left few clues to his personal views of the legislation that he must now help implement, lobbyists and political sources have said. Wetjen, named by President Barack Obama to replace retiring Democrat Michael Dunn, is expected by many to join forces with CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and Bart Chilton in pressing forward quickly with reforms.
