Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, owns an 18 percent stake in J.C. Penney. The company's troubles have left his portfolio with some $500 million in losses. The board has now turned to Myron Ullman, Johnson's predecessor. In the past, Ackman had been openly critical of Ullman, saying as recently as last May that the department store operator had been chronically mismanaged and had failed to create value for shareholders for the last 20 years.

Even though Johnson worked hard, Ackman said the lack of his physical presence "affected the morale of the home team." This is the first time Ackman, a J.C. Penney board member since 2011, has spoken publicly since Johnson, the Apple alum he chose to lead the turnaround, was dismissed from his position on Monday.

What the company needs now though, is somebody who can "stabilize the place" and "calm the vendors", Ackman said, calling Ullman "the right guy at the right time". The company will return to offering newspaper circulars shortly, Ackman said. J.C. Penney was not immediately available for comment. Johnson could not be reached for comment.

He described Johnson as being brilliant and visionary, but said the team lacked strong enough operational talent. "The execution, the basic blocking and tackling of running a retailer -- that's what Ron (Johnson) didn't have," Ackman said. For that, he called out Mike Kramer, the chief operating officer, who has left the company, he said.

OFF THE RECORD At the luncheon, which was attended by hundreds of people and sponsored by New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate, Ackman had asked for his comments on J.C. Penney to be off the record. No reporters objected at the time, though his comments were soon reported by other news outlets.
