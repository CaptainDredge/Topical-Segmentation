The Fed Board announced a 25 basis-point discount rate cut to 4.75 percent on December 11, 2007, at the same time the Federal Open Market Committee cut the benchmark federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. Ahead of the meeting, seven Fed banks sought a quarter-percentage-point discount rate cut, while two Fed banks -- Kansas City and Dallas -- sought to keep the rate unchanged at 5.0 percent.

The decision came just after a better-than-expected November payrolls report, but just before data showed stronger-than-expected retail sales and the biggest surge in consumer prices in more than two years. Since then, a number of key indicators, including weak December payrolls, have pointed to a steepening slowdown. Fed bank directors who favored the quarter-point discount rate cut in December agreed that downside risks to economic growth had increased and conditions in financial markets had recently deteriorated.

Analysts said the disparity showed a healthy debate at the Fed over inflation and emerging risks to growth. "This represents the fact that different FOMC members view the risks around forecasts differently," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh. "Going forward, the picture maybe a little clearer on the downside to growth, but the picture on inflation has not yet crystallized." Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren was the sole dissenter in the December 11 FOMC decision, instead preferring a deeper 50-basis-point cut.

"Federal Reserve bank directors in favor of a 50-basis-point cut expressed similar concerns," the Fed said in the minutes. "They believed, however, that financial market conditions and the economic outlook necessitated a larger reduction in order to provide some insurance against a more serious economic downturn," they said. Fed bank directors who preferred a steady discount rate saw incoming evidence of slower growth to be within their expectation and viewed the repricing of credit to be a "necessary adjustment." "In the absence of new material information, they considered concerns about a slowdown in economic activity to be offset by continued inflation pressures and judged that an unchanged primary credit was appropriate," the minutes said.
