The same poll pointed to Airbus earnings of 1.21 billion euros on revenue of 27.32 billion. For 2009, EADS said a previously published Airbus order forecast of 300-400 planes was "challenging" and that the planemaker faced increasing uncertainties over the second half. It predicted roughly stable group revenue and operating profit before one-offs that would be "down in 2009 but significantly positive." CANCELLATION RISK Analysts have expressed concerns over potential strains on EADS' cash pile, which stood at 9.2 billion euros at the end of 2008, as airlines tap it for financing to preserve plane orders.

EADS is trying to negotiate a new timetable for the plane, which has been delayed by 3-4 years due to development problems. Revenue grew 11 percent in 2008 to 43.27 billion euros, EADS said, confirming a newspaper report based on a staff newsletter. Airbus, which saw record deliveries in 2008 despite growing doubts over future demand, swung to an operating profit of 1.79 billion euros from an 881 million loss in 2007 as its revenue grew 9 percent to 27.45 billion euros.

The total amount that could potentially have to be paid back is around 5.7 billion euros, EADS said. "This termination may only be obtained with a unanimous mandate of all launch nations, which makes it very unlikely according to the assessment of the EADS management," it said. A German official told Reuters on Monday that countries that ordered the plane, led by Germany, France and Britain, could give EADS an extra few months of breathing space before deciding whether to cancel the plane.

PARIS  (Reuters) - European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ) reported a sharp rise in 2008 operating profit despite fresh charges for its delayed A400M military plane on Tuesday, beating expectations as its Airbus unit climbed out of the red.The world's second largest aerospace group after Boeing warned of "significant" further charges in 2009 for the A400M and acknowledged European nations soon had a right to cancel the 20 billion euros ($25.29 billion) project -- while calling this "very unlikely." Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and certain other items, or operating income, rose to 2.83 billion euros from just 52 million euros in 2007 when profits had been hit by restructuring charges, program delays and a weak dollar.
