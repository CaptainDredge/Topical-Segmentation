A second person, identified as Carlos Peralta, was charged with involvement in the scheme to defraud the church pastors. He was arrested in Colorado and was expected to appear in court in Denver. On Friday, regulators closed Park Avenue Bank and its deposits were sold to Valley Valley National Bank, part of Valley National Bancorp of Wayne, NJ.

A 10-count criminal complaint said Charles Antonucci devised "an elaborate round-trip loan transaction" that he told others was his own $6.5 million investment in Park Avenue Bank, misleading bank regulators. Antonucci made false statements in the bank's application for $11.2 million from TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, according to the complaint.

"The charges today send a powerful message to those who tried to steal from the TARP, those who have stolen from the TARP and those who are contemplating similar fraudulent action," Barofsky said. "You will be tracked down; you will be caught; you will be arrested; and you will be brought to justice." Bharara described a complex fraud, including a line of credit through a company called "Easy Wealth;" overdrafts to companies controlled by an unidentified co-conspirator; leases on personal property paid by the bank; a counterfeit certificate of deposit; and a $100,000 defrauding of the pastors of a church in Coral Springs, Florida.

Investigators from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) first received a tip in Ecuador that someone there was interested in making an illegal business deal with Antonucci, ICE special-agent-in-charge James Hayes told reporters. The criminal complaint said that "while the bank's TARP application was under review by the FDIC, Charles Antonucci encouraged and caused other individuals acting on behalf of the bank to encourage the FDIC to grant the bank's TARP application, in part on the basis of Antonucci's purported personal investment of $6.5 million in new capital." Antonucci and others "repeatedly singled out Antonucci's $6.5 million capital investment as evidence that the bank was viable and deserving of TARP funds." Instead, the complaint said, the investment "was a sham, round-trip transaction using the bank's own funds and was designed, at least in part, to deceive regulators about the bank's capital position." In November 2008, Park Avenue Bank applied for a bailout of less than $12 million under the TARP program, but withdrew its application over concerns about restrictions on banks that receive taxpayer money, bank chairman Donald Glascoff said a year ago.

The regulators determined Park Avenue Bank was badly managed and "critically undercapitalized," according to a statement on Friday by the New York State Banking Superintendent. Antonucci was president of the bank from June 2004 to October 2009 and the alleged offenses occurred between October 2008 and February 2009, according to the court document.
