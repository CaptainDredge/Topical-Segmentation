SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O has hired Solectron Corp. SLR.N Chief Executive Michael Cannon to the newly created position of president of global operations, as the No. 2 personal computer maker seeks to retake market share from Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N )Dell said Cannon, whose departure from Solectron was announced on Wednesday, will take up his new role on February 26.

Dell stumbled under Rollins, with revenue growth slowing to less than 4 percent, from 21 percent three years ago, as competitors lowered prices and narrowed the price advantage afforded by Dell's direct-sales model. The company last summer also faced the largest recall in U.S. consumer electronics history after several Sony Corp.

Solectron Chief Financial Officer Paul Tufano will become interim CEO. Solectron is the world's second-largest electronics contract manufacturer and a Dell supplier. The hiring of Cannon came after Michael Dell, 41, retook the helm of the company he founded, replacing Kevin Rollins as CEO. Dell last year lost its position at the top of the PC market to HP, which has expanded in notebook computers, consumer electronics and printers -- areas in which Dell lags.

Cannon, who will report to Michael Dell, will oversee operations, supply chain logistics and product design in the company's nine factories, including five in the United States. Dell spokesman Dwayne Cox said Michael Dell told employees in a memo on Wednesday that Cannon and his new organization would "focus on streamlining processes and structures, redeploying resources to drive more value for customers and innovate our supply chain model to differentiate our products." Dell's statement made no mention of job cuts, but the CEO had told employees in a February 2 e-mail that he wanted to "eliminate redundancies" and scrap employee bonuses this year as he tries to cut red tape that "slows us down." Solectron, based in Milpitas, California, gets less than 10 percent of its revenue from Dell, spokesman Michael Busselen said, adding that the company hopes to maintain good relations with Dell.

"It's in our best interest to maintain a posture in which we might do more work with customers in the future," Busselen said. "We have made great progress in returning Solectron to growth and profitability during Mike's four years as CEO," Solectron Chairman Bill Hasler said in a statement. Shares of Round Rock, Texas-based Dell were little changed at $23.92 following the announcement, after closing up 1.23 percent at $23.90 on the Nasdaq.
