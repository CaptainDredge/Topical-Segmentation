Barclays analyst Roger Freeman said that on a comparable basis, Morgan Stanley's FICC results were down by almost half. "To be sure, FICC did have a challenging quarter," he said. BROAD IMPROVEMENTS Even with the wealth management and FICC difficulties, Morgan Stanley impressed investors, providing much-needed relief at the end of what was a mixed earnings season for the big U.S. banks.

Net revenue of $9.3 billion was up a stronger-than-expected 17 percent from a year ago, and for the first time since the financial crisis, surpassed that of Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley shares rose 11.4 percent to close at $24.20, their highest level since the end of May. But even as investors cheered, Morgan Stanley's top brass sounded a note of caution over the investment bank's wealth management business, whose profits still lag expectations.

"Margins must improve and do so soon," a slightly impatient-sounding Chief Executive James Gorman told analysts in a conference call. Gorman, a former McKinsey consultant who spent years running Merrill Lynch's retail brokerage, is struggling to rein in expenses in the wealth management business on which he is betting much of his reputation.

Morgan Stanley in June 2009 bought a majority interest in Citigroup's Smith Barney brokerage group. The combined wealth management business accounted for about 15 percent of the company's income during the second quarter, but its profitability has sagged because of stubbornly high expenses. While Gorman expects the business to eventually deliver a pretax operating margin of 20 percent, the margin declined to 9 percent in the second quarter from 10 percent three months ago.

"Every one of their divisions shows an improvement, and the improvement in trading operations is especially impressive." Results were boosted by a strong increase in equity sales and trading revenue, up by more than a third from a year ago at $1.9 billion. The investment banking business also showed strength, with revenue up 66 percent at $1.5 billion.
