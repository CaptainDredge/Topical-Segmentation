And while the mid-market private equity sector is still seeing deals, they are not big enough to keep the numbers -- and banker fees -- as high as they were. "We are still seeing a healthy number of deals -- albeit lower than the first half of last year -- but on average they are smaller than in the recent past, and that pattern seems likely to continue during the rest of the year," said Ian Hart, Citigroup's co-head of M&A for Europe, Middle-East and Africa.

In the U.S., the world's biggest economy, a slowdown and bleak outlook were compounded this week as U.S. consumer confidence hit a 16-year low and housing prices suffered a record annual drop. The slowdown that started with the credit crunch last summer has spread and is now undermining much of the economic stability in Europe and the U.S. that allowed the M&A boom.

Private equity buyout activity, which underpinned the recent M&A boom, fell 66 percent in Europe to $48 billion and slumped by 86 percent in the United States to $42 billion in the first half. With inflation rising and no end in sight for economic woes in the U.S. and Europe, it seems unlikely that volumes will recover quickly to the record levels seen for the year until June 2007, observers said.

"There are two schools of thought," said Merrill Lynch's Carlo Calabria. "The first is that M&A will come back toward the end of the year. The second is this may be the beginning of a bit of an ice age, and we should try to collect all the nuts." (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)

"We won't see a boom like early 2007 again for another three or four years," said Hermann Prelle, joint-head of EMEA investment banking at UBS. Several banks, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) have already shed M&A jobs to try to adapt to the slower market, and there could be more cuts as the slowdown in activity eats into banks' income.
