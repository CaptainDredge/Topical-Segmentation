Planned layoffs in October were driven by the automobile industry, with 13,420 announced layoffs. The sector, with a total of 164,440 planned layoffs this year, may see more downsizing in 2009, the report said. Government and non-profit entities rank second in year-to-date payroll reductions, with announced layoffs of 160,434 workers. The sector is poised for more cuts as many state and local governments grapple with hefty budget deficits.

The total announced layoffs this year are just 31,406 shy of last year's total of 1.22 million.

John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray, cautioned that the employment market recovery will not be as swift as its fall. "Companies will, at first, be very cautious not to over-hire, in case this recovery is not sustainable. Even when the pace of job creation accelerates, it simply will take a lot of time to reabsorb all of these displaced workers," he said in a statement.
