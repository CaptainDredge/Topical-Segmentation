NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc reported strong increases in quarterly profit and revenue, helped by a significant rise in its gross margin.COMMENTARY: DANIEL ERNST, ANALYST, HUDSON SQUARE RESEARCH "It was a very good quarter, as expected. It's a continued sign that Apple has great products that consumers want despite this recession.

Macs continue to gain share and what's interesting is that it only has 3.6 percent share globally so there's a lot of headroom." BRIAN MARSHALL, ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH "Clearly the Macs were the highlight and a little bit above my estimate. The iPhones look a little light and iPods are pretty much in line." MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO, SAN FRANCISCO "One of the big problems with fourth-quarter earnings, especially with technology companies, is there's a lull that follows holiday sales." "(Apple) finished strong and it's going to use that momentum to bring new products to stay on top of the competition." "The revenue beat was very strong." KEITH SPRINGER, PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES, SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA "It's another sneak attack by Apple." "The only bad part I saw were the iPod sales down 8 percent, but I imagine that they made up by the iPhone." "It looks like they're still picking up market share.

They did 8.7 (million) iPhones -- underneath some of the more bullish expectations but they did 4.4 (million) the year before ... and they hadn't added a lot of new distribution in the quarter. This was just more of a same-store sales kind of figure showing the demand." "Mac sales were phenomenal as well ...

But even on that basis the company was able to beat Wall Street forecasts." "We think it just highlights the fact that Apple's earnings' power is consistently underestimated." "Overall a very strong quarter." "With regards to revenue, Mac sales were very strong, which more than offset what might be perceived as a ho-hum iPhone number." "Maybe some on the Street were getting a little euphoric with their expectations on the iPhone." "I think overall there's a lot of potential catalysts as we head into 2010, whether it's the forthcoming table or the iPhone's migration to new carriers." "The margin profile looked very strong.
