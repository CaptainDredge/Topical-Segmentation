"Alcoa has been one of those commodity stocks that has been beaten up," said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. "However, investors who believe that the worldwide economies are going to start to turn around and are beginning to show signs of light at the end of the tunnel have begun buying shares of Alcoa." He also said next week's Alcoa results "may be better than a lot of the gloomier estimates." Frederic Ruffy, an options strategist at WhatsTrading.com, said Alcoa's rise was probably a "technical bounce" after Monday's sell-off, which he called an "overreaction." He also said Alcoa stock "might be getting a lift from end-of-quarter position squaring" and window-dressing by institutional holders.

"Alcoa fits in all the BHP boxes in my view about tier one assets as well as leading global market shares," said Aitken.
