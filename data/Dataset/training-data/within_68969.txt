"People realize that something will happen, if anything because clients are demanding it." ETFs are mutual funds traded like a stock and are popular because of their cheap fees. Although regulatory concerns have been brewing for months, they have most recently been caught up in alleged rogue trades that triggered $2.3 billion losses at Swiss bank UBS.

PARIS  (Reuters) - Top heavyweights from the $1.3 trillion exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry are bracing themselves for a shift in how their fast-growing but relatively opaque products are marketed, distributed and regulated.During a three-hour hearing in Paris on Monday, executives from ETF providers like BlackRock, Societe Generale unit Lyxor and Natixis unit Ossiam picked apart the European Securities and Markets Authority's (ESMA) recent proposals to make ETFs more transparent and ultimately less risky for investors.

Complex ETFs now make up half the market in Europe and regulators worry they leave investors with open ended exposures. ESMA's representatives expressed concerns about the recent growth spurt of ETFs and whether there was enough disclosure and transparency to allow retail investors to really understand the product.

"They have to be able to understand what they buy." ESMA is looking at possible curbs on sales of complex ETFs to small investors. Its chairman, Steven Maijoor, said in July the emphasis would be on giving investors more information about risks, though curbs could not be ruled out. However, several executives at the hearing cried foul over what they saw as excessive demands for transparency and disclosure on the composition of ETFs. One PriceWaterhouseCoopers representative told the hearing: "If you get down to a daily, single-position transparency, then this will be the death of this product." The European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) told ESMA's consultation there is generally no need for ETF-specific regulation as the EU framework provides for a "very high level of investor protection."
