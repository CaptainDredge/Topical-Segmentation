Some of these bank directors viewed the news on inflation as encouraging but believed risks to price stability remained, while others worried about big increases in the cost of food, energy and other commodities. Still, they believed a quarter-point rate cut would appropriately balance growth and inflation risks. In pushing for a larger rate cut, the Boston Fed argued that greater economic slack would curb price pressures and that a half-point reduction was appropriate to "reduce the risk of a serious downturn." The other seven Fed banks "viewed concerns about the outlook for inflation as offsetting concerns about the subdued outlook for the real economy," the minutes said.

The minutes said the boards of directors at the four regional banks seeking a quarter-point reduction in the discount rate -- New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and San Francisco -- were concerned about the near-term prospects for the economy, even while some worried about price pressures. "Several directors noted that significant downside risks to economic growth remained, including the potential for a further weakening of labor markets and the possibility that the contraction in the housing sector would be deeper and more prolonged than currently expected," they said.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The 12 regional U.S. Federal Reserve banks were split on the appropriate interest-rate stance ahead of the Fed's policy-setting meeting at the end of April, minutes of Fed meetings released on Tuesday showed.The directors of seven regional Fed banks voted ahead of the central bank's April 30 policy-setting session to hold the discount rate charged on direct Fed loans to banks steady at 2.5 percent, according to minutes of Fed board meetings.

Four other regional Fed banks had requested the Fed Board of Governors to approve a quarter-percentage point reduction in the discount rate, while another -- the Boston Federal Reserve Bank -- wanted a deeper half-point cut. The Fed's board approved a quarter-point reduction to 2.25 percent on April 30, an action taken in concert with a decision by the central bank's main policy-setting body, the Federal Open Mark Committee, to lower the overnight interbank federal funds rate by a matching quarter-point to 2 percent.

"In part because of the significant lag before the full effects of past monetary policy easing would be realized, these directors concluded that no change in the existing rate was appropriate at this time," they said. In announcing its decision to lower the federal funds rate on April 30, the FOMC signaled a desire to step to the sidelines to gauge the impact of the cumulative 3.25 percentage point reduction in the overnight rate since mid-September.
