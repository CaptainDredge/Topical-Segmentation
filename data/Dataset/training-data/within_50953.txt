According to the French government source, Paris believes firmer budget commitments by euro zone governments and other concessions such as approving Bundesbank President Axel Weber to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet at the head of the European Central Bank, could enable a rapprochement with Berlin. He added new EU institutions for economic governance would not likely see the light of day any time soon.

BERLIN/PARIS  (Reuters) - The leaders of France and Germany will seek to overcome deep-rooted disagreements on European economic governance at a meeting in Berlin Monday, setting the tone for a European Union summit later this week.A show of unity from Berlin and Paris, the motors behind European integration, is seen as crucial for reaching decisions at the summit Thursday on tightening policy coordination and strengthening budget discipline to contain a debt crisis.

"You cannot have one country (Germany) where everything is oriented toward gains in productivity and competitiveness and other countries favoring consumption and social protection. "Either we manage to come closer or we risk having a political crisis as well as an economic and financial crisis." Yet Paris and Berlin are at loggerheads over the correct approach to closer economic governance -- so much so that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy postponed their talks initially scheduled for last week for fear they would be unable to reach an agreement, the source said.

CONCESSIONS Nonetheless, Sarkozy and Merkel went some way to assuaging concerns about a French-German rift last week by issuing a letter to the European Commission calling for faster financial reform and an EU-wide ban on naked short selling of shares and sovereign bonds. In addition, France looked to anchor its commitment to tighter fiscal policy at the weekend by pledging to cut the budget deficit by 100 billion euros by 2013 and to bring it down to the EU target of 3 percent of GDP.

Paris has also called for Germany to boost domestic spending in order to balance its huge trade surplus. Berlin last week launched the biggest austerity drive in Germany since World War Two and sees budget discipline as a priority, pressing Paris to implement savings measures. The German Finance Ministry has circulated a 9-point plan demanding stiffer sanctions against governments that flout European fiscal rules, including suspending repeat offenders' EU voting rights, and an insolvency procedure for states.
