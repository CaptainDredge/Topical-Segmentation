Samsung said it would invest more than 5.5 trillion won ($4.64 billion) in memory chips and around 3 trillion won in the liquid crystal display (LCD) business in 2010, on a consolidated basis, after investing some 7 trillion won company-wide in 2009.

"But the macroeconomy remains a factor -- demand may weaken once stimulus plans are removed." Samsung reported a record quarterly net profit on Friday thanks to resurgent sales and forecast a strong 2010 even as analysts cited risks of a fast recovering won and increased marketing spending.
