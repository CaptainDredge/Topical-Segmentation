This view differs to that of European Union officials who are openly suggesting the Private Sector Initiative (PSI) contribution may now have to be increased to reflect a worsening Greek economic situation. Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said: "As far as the PSI is concerned, we have to take into account the fact that we have experienced changes since the decisions we took on July 21, so we are considering technical revisions." Bankers have so far dug in their heels over increasing their share of the burden, given the uncertainty over the extent of collateral damage to the already fragile European banking sector from a possible Greek default.

They argue that an imperfect deal is better than none. To reopen the talks would destroy the hard-won approval for the plan, which has been gained from a disparate group of investors in Greek bonds, including large European banks and insurers. To undo this would compromise the whole bailout deal and further undermine European credibility among investors who want to see action taken to address Greece's chronic debt problem and growing economic woes, bankers say.

The bank lobby group that has led the negotiations over bailing out Greece said on Tuesday that it was sticking with the original plan and progress was being made on implementing it. "Those agreements will provide substantial cash-flow relief, assured financing and debt reduction, and so move Greece toward debt sustainability," Frank Vogl, a spokesman for the Institute of International Finance, told Reuters by email.

"The possibility of a 50 percent haircut has receded significantly in the last week and a half. At that point it was being discussed seriously and at the highest level," an Athens-based banker involved in the Greek privatization program said. "I think it has receded because wiping 50 percent off the Greek banking sector would destroy us, and the European Central Bank has 100 billion euros of exposure to Greek banks." One option being considered is for the private sector to shore up Greece's finances by widening the debt covered by the PSI initiative to include longer-dated maturities, a source familiar with the talks said.

"The impact of such a move will be incalculable. This is why I am warning in the most forceful way against any material revision," he said. The PSI is arranged so that the so-called haircut will always be at least 21 percent, depending on Greek interest rates. And many financial institutions have already marked their own exposures down well below this level to reflect market prices -- a writedown of around 50 percent -- for Greek bonds.
