Taubman, global head of investment banking since 2007, has more than 25 years with Morgan Stanley. Earlier, he was global head of mergers and acquisitions. Kelleher became chief financial officer in 2007, previously working as head of global capital markets. He joined the firm in 1989. Kelleher's move to institutional securities left an opening for Porat, 52, to take over as chief financial officer.

Both Kelleher and Taubman were seen as candidates to replace Mack, who will retain the title of chairman. Michael Hecht, an analyst with JMP Securities, said Kelleher and Taubman would have ample opportunity to burnish their resumes for future CEO jobs while running institutional securities. "The best way to do that is to have more experience running a business and successfully fixing a business where they had the biggest competitive gap and the biggest opportunity," Hecht said.

Ruth Porat, global head of the financial institutions group, was named chief financial officer, succeeding Kelleher. Morgan Stanley swung to a profit in the third quarter, joining competitors like Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co in the rebound that has swept the industry since last year's crisis. But its trading operations have lagged both rivals.

Overall, the institutional business posted pre-tax income of $1.3 billion in the third quarter. "We have more work to do in our trading business, and Colm, Paul and I are all committed to continuing to attract world-class sales and trading talent in the months ahead," Gorman, 51, wrote in an internal memo.
