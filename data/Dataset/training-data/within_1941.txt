"For one thing, it puts us, the domestic manufacturers, atodds with the desires of most of our customers, namely largervehicles," Lutz said in a year-end posting on a Web sitemaintained by GM.

Auto executives have argued that the industry's flatoverall fuel economy in recent years reflects the strongpreference for trucks and SUVs by American drivers, a pointLutz made in his Internet posting.
