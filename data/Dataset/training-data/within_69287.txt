The inspectors also visited opposition leader Antonis Samaras, whose anti-austerity stance has put his conservative New Democracy party ahead of the ruling Socialists by up to 6 points in the latest opinion polls. No statements were made after the visit. (Writing by Harry Papachristou; additional reporting by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Paul Taylor and Roger Atwood)

If Greece's international lenders, known as the troika, conclude in a report to be issued this month that recession will continue to be worse than predicted, EU officials have suggested that banks that agreed in July to write off 21 percent of the value of their Greek debt holdings may be forced to take deeper losses.

ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece will remain trapped in recession next year, threatening the country's efforts to cut deficits and claw its way out of a debt crisis shaking the euro zone, budget figures showed Monday.The economy will suffer a fourth consecutive year of contraction, shrinking by 2.5 percent in 2012 after an expected 5.5 percent slump this year, according to the 2012 budget draft submitted to parliament after talks with international lenders.

Tough new measures, including the property tax and public sector layoffs, are meant to narrow the budget gap to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2012, slightly higher than the 6.5 percent goal agreed with international inspectors in July, due to a deeper recession. About 30,000 civil servants will be put in a so-called Labor Reserve, effectively a one-year waiting room for dismissal, on 60 percent of their salary.

Greeks must also pay as much as 16 euros a year for each square meter of real estate they own. Hundreds of demonstrators took again to the streets on Monday to protest against budget cuts and EU/IMF-imposed reforms to open up its sclerotic economy. About 300 high-school students demonstrated outside parliament to oppose planned school mergers, a university reform and the austerity imposed on their parents.
