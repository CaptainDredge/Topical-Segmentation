Defensive stocks typically have more predictable revenues, which makes them attractive during volatile markets. The iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund ( SLV.P ) took in $311.5 million of new money in the week ended Wednesday, data from Lipper showed. That followed record redemptions of $1.01 billion the previous week. Total assets in the fund fell, however, to $13.25 billion from $13.30 billion as the week's net inflows were more than offset by $368.9 million in declines due to market performance.

The strong performance by defensive shares, such as health care and consumer staples, suggested investors were still attracted to stocks while other asset classes made them more nervous. "Fixed income investments don't seem very attractive at the current yield. There's some concern about commodities. The volatility has scared a lot of people away, so I think a lot of investors are sitting back and saying, 'Where can I put my money?' and the stock market is that," said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
