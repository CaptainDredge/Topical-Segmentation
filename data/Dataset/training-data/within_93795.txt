"I do believe there is a shifting of global gear that is going on - and you won't see it just now - but if you do prospecting for three to four years, a couple of emerging economies will come out as the growth drivers of the world," he said. While China, India, Indonesia and Brazil are leading emerging economies, several African economies have adopted economic reforms that have fueled investor interest and boosted growth, he said.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The World Bank's new chief economist on Tuesday urged Group of 20 finance leaders to better coordinate economic policies in order to prevent a possible global currency war.In an interview with Reuters, Kaushik Basu said G20 finance ministers, meeting in Moscow on February 15 and 16, should act on a solution before escalating tensions spark another global economic crisis.

Basu said trade among emerging economies was increasing, while savings and investment rates were rising in middle-income countries, which would support stronger economic growth. "Eventually, I expect industrialized countries to go back to slightly higher growth, which for them is fine because they are already developed, and I expect some emerging economies to get back to between 8 and 9 percent growth, which they had before the global financial crisis," Basu added.

"Global leaders need to coordinate policy to prevent either (one) from happening or markets believing it is happening. Such coordination is entirely within the realm of the possible; all it needs is determination." He said that, while unconventional monetary policy measures by central banks in the United States, Japan and Europe to revive growth had proved valuable, the impact of those policies was "beginning to feed into the global situation".

While the risk of a sudden plummeting of the global economy had diminished because of measures adopted in Europe to ease its sovereign debt crisis, a rapid bounce-back in growth was unlikely, he said. "We are not in a currency war but could be inching towards one," said Basu, a former chief economic adviser to the Indian finance ministry.
