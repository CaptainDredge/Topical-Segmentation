Nearly 8 million stores, restaurants and other merchants that accept credit cards have been given until May 28 to opt out or object to the deal. If merchants opt out, they will not be eligible to receive a portion of the monetary damages. But they note that they will be bound by parts of the settlement that would prohibit them from suing Visa and Mastercard over similar interchange issues in the future, if the settlement is approved.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A major retail trade association said Wednesday it will reject a proposed $7.2 billion settlement with credit-card giants Visa Inc ( V.N ) and Mastercard Inc ( MA.N ) over card fees, calling it a "bad deal" for nearly 8 million U.S. merchants.The Retail Industry Leaders Association, or RILA, said it intends to "make a statement" by opting out of the potentially historic settlement just as lead lawyers for the plaintiffs and credit-card companies are preparing to file papers seeking final approval from a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y. RILA represents some of the largest U.S. retailers, including Walmart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), Target Corp ( TGT.N ) and Home Depot Inc, all of which have previously expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed settlement.

RILA general counsel Deborah White said that the group is opting out of the settlement on its own behalf, and that each of its members will have to decide individually whether to object, opt out, or stay in the litigation. "We do have the support from a large majority of our membership for opting out and objecting, and we want to make sure we're shedding light on what the true ramifications are for the proposed settlement," White said in an interview.

The move could prompt a new round of criticism of the deal from large U.S. retailers and possibly more opt-outs. The credit card companies believe they have a judge's backing in the settlement, but a high number of opt-outs could imperil the hard-fought pact. The proposed settlement, announced last year, would resolve an eight-year old lawsuit on behalf of U.S. merchants accusing Visa and Mastercard of artificially raising interchange, or swipe, fees, which are paid to process credit-card transactions.

The group believes that the litigation releases in the settlement will force merchants to forego future legal claims against Visa and Mastercard in exchange for "paltry" monetary relief over years of harm from swipe fees, which have cost merchants billions of dollars, White said. RILA is among the first major trade groups to come out swinging against the deal, which drew a flurry of opposition at the preliminary approval stage last year.
