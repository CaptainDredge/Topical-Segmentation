But they have not shown any indications yet that they are serious about this." CITIBANK: "The Moody's action is in line with our view that recent economic policy decisions in Hungary resulted in a deterioration of medium term fiscal outlook and less predictable business environment. Hungary stands out in terms of ratings as compared to other Central European countries, including Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia." "And although so far financial markets have remained relatively calm, a mix of a rating downgrade, disappointing fiscal adjustment and high external vulnerabilities could lead to higher FX volatility in the coming weeks, especially if the euro area sovereign debt crisis intensifies." UNICREDIT "Although the market reaction was immediately negative (5Y CDS jumping to 375-390bp, EUR/HUF jumping by about 1 percent and rates moving higher by about 10bp) we note that the credit market has already priced in a downgrade.

Cutting income taxes, introducing punitive taxes on selective sectors (finance, energy, telecom, retail), nationalizing the pension system, and gutting the fiscal oversight agency does not count as responsible fiscal consolidation." "A further downgrade (to below investment grade) would be very problematic, particularly for 2012-14 when Hungary needs to repay its EU and IMF loans." "Tensions between the government and central bank are likely to continue, which may lead to more market volatility (and conflict with the EU)."
