BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) expects the U.S. nonresidential construction market to slow this year as the ripples of the housing slump spread, a top executive said on Friday."There will be a spillover from the slowdown in the U.S. residential markets into the broader economy which, for us, will most significantly impact ...

nonresidential construction," said Dave Anderson, chief financial officer. So far the Morris Township, New Jersey-based company has not seen the effects of the possible slowdown in its financial results, he said. Honeywell late on Thursday reported results that met Wall Street's expectations, including 10 percent profit growth at its automation and control solutions unit, which makes thermostats, security systems and other products used in homes and commercial buildings.

Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), which reported profit that matched Wall Street's expectations on Friday, said its sales related to nonresidential construction declined in 2007 and agreed the sector could weaken this year. Honeywell expects any slowdown in nonresidential building to be less sharp than the two-year slump in the U.S. housing market.

That reflects a sharp drop from 7.5 percent growth last year. "The general consensus is today that we're still experiencing growth in the nonresidential markets and that that growth will continue at least through 2008, driven mostly by strength in institutional as opposed to commercial markets," Anderson said. On the nonresidential side, he said he expects demand this year for institutional buildings like hospitals, airports and government buildings to be stronger than demand for offices and factories.

U.S. nonresidential construction accounts for 10 to 15 percent of Honeywell's $35 billion in annual revenue, more than the roughly 5 percent that U.S. residential construction represents, Anderson said in an interview. A survey released this month by the American Institute of Architects predicted that U.S. nonresidential building would rise by about 0.7 percent this year and decline by 0.9 percent in 2009.
