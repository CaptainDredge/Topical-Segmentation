SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc posted quarterly results that beat Wall Street forecasts and gave a more optimistic view for the rest of the year, driving up its shares 10 percent on Tuesday.Net profit was slightly lower than in the year-earlier third quarter but revenue far exceeded Wall Street expectations.

-----

The company said in July it would conduct a 100-day review of its businesses, and many analysts and investors were looking to the company's conference call later on Tuesday for details. Yahoo also said full-year 2007 results were expected to land at the upper end of current Wall Street expectations, with revenue, excluding payments to affiliates, of $5.02 billion to $5.16 billion.

Yahoo said third-quarter net profit fell slightly to $151 million, or 11 cents per share, from $158.5 million, or 11 cents per share, in the year-ago period when the company had significantly more shares outstanding. Gross revenue rose 12 percent to $1.77 billion. Excluding payments to advertising partners, or so-called traffic acquisition costs, revenue rose 14 percent to $1.28 billion.

Analysts had braced for lower profits, with a consensus forecast for net profit of $113.8 million, or 8 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. They had expected revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, of $1.24 billion. Wall Street has been calling on Yahoo to consider more drastic moves for its businesses after a string of earnings disappointments stretching back to early 2006.

-----

The latest Wall Street forecasts ranged from $4.90 billion to $5.18 billion, excluding payments to affiliates, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Yahoo closed down 4.2 percent at $26.69 on Nasdaq but jumped more than 10 percent following the report to $29.44 in after-hours trading. As of Tuesday's closing price, Yahoo shares were 20 percent ahead of 2-1/2 year lows set in August as Wall Street is betting on bold moves by Chief Executive Jerry Yang to shake up its strategy and close in on rival Google Inc.
