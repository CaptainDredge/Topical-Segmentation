Investors, faced with such risks, may opt to pack it in for the year and live to trade another day. "We're seeing moves in one day that in normal times we would see in the course of a year," said Quincy Krosby, market analyst at Prudential Financial in Newark. "That makes for a very difficult market to navigate." It hasn't been a robust year to begin with -- the S&P 500 is down 2.8 percent so far in 2011.

(Reuters) - U.S. regulators started raising concerns about MF Global's European sovereign debt exposure as early as June, according to a source familiar with the matter, four months before the company's collapse into bankruptcy.The meltdown of Jon Corzine's firm after high-risk bets on European debt should spark reforms to separate retail from investment banking operations, according "Bond King" Bill Gross, who says it marks another example of how Wall Street has "lost its way." Not long ago, Wall Street was witnessing the comeback of Corzine, the ex-Goldman Sachs chief and former New Jersey governor, when he took the helm of MF Global.

"What I'm expressing here, obviously, is not that I want people to commit suicide," Grassley said on Tuesday. "But I do feel very strongly that we have not had statements of apology, statements of remorse, statements of contrition on the part of CEOs of manufacturing companies or banks or financial services or insurance companies that are asking for bailouts, that they understand that they are responsible for running their corporation into the ground." On Monday, in an interview with a radio station in his home state of Iowa, Grassley fired a gibe at AIG executives, saying they might "follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, I'm sorry, and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide." AIG called those comments "very disappointing." President Barack Obama on Monday expressed "outrage" about the AIG bonuses, and lawmakers in Congress on Tuesday called either for AIG to be sued to recover the bonuses, or for the government to levy hefty taxes on bonus recipients.
