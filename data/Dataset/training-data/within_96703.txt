Google improved its cost-per-click, a critical metric that refers to the price advertisers pay the Internet search giant, in the first quarter.

NEW PRODUCTS KEY TO FUTURE Google CEO Larry Page spent much of the conference call discussing new products such as the Google Glass wearable computers and high-speed fiber networks that the company is developing, which he said were vital to the company's future success. "If you look at most companies they never do anything different, and eventually they run into problems for that reason," said the 40-year-old Page, who co-founded Google in 1998 with Sergey Brin.
