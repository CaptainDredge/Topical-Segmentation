A consolidated shareholder complaint in the case is scheduled to be filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by Monday. An earlier version accused Citigroup and several individuals, including former CEO Charles Prince, of violating securities law by artificially boosting the bank's stock price by concealing its exposure to subprime-linked debt.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - After Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) shares tumbled last year on the bank's subprime mortgage woes, angry investors sued for fraud. Now, stockholders are due to file a new version of their lawsuit as their losses have become much more stark.A lot has changed for the worse for Citigroup stockholders since the lawsuit about its subprime debt exposure was first brought in November 2007.

Citigroup believes the lawsuit "is without merit, and will defend against it vigorously," company spokesman Mike Hanretta said on Tuesday. The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status on behalf of a large group of stockholders, could be among the biggest subprime-related cases moving through U.S. courts, given Citigroup's huge stock market declines.

The bank's shares are trading at around $6 apiece compared with $31 a year ago -- even after two government bailouts in the last two months. The U.S. government this week agreed to inject $20 billion of capital and shoulder nearly $250 billion in potential losses on about $306 billion of the bank's risky assets -- after injecting $25 billion of taxpayer money in October.

A lawyer for the shareholders, Ira Press of law firm Kirby McInerney LLP in New York, declined to comment about the specifics of the new court complaint, saying it is still being drafted. "If last week is any indication, the story may still be unfolding," he said. "We are obviously continuously monitoring the unfolding events." The original lawsuit was filed by an individual investor.
