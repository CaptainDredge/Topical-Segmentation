CDL blamed slowing corporate and conferences demand for the sluggish performance. RECOVERY STALLS A booming financial services industry and the launch of two new casino resorts in 2010 helped Singapore's hotels come roaring back after the global financial crisis, which drove down the occupancy rate to just 76 percent in 2009.

"We will see a slight drop in occupancy rate (in Singapore) mainly due to new supply that is about to come on board in 2013," said Jonas Ogren, Asia director at hotel data provider STR Global, based in Singapore. "In Hong Kong, we are not seeing so much new supply coming on board, which means the hotels that are already there will continue to do better and better." The supply of four- and five-star hotel rooms in Singapore is expected to increase by 17.4 percent from 2011 to 2014, while Hong Kong's will grow by just 13.5 percent, according to real estate services firm CBRE.

Shares of Central Plaza have more than doubled so far this year, while Minor has surged 87 percent versus a 25 percent rise in the broader index .SETI. Units of CDL are up 17 percent on the year, but they have dropped 9 percent since the company released its weaker-than-expected third-quarter results on October 30.

SOUTHEAST ASIA BOOMS While's Singapore's hotel market slows, other parts of Southeast Asia are picking up. Thailand's top two hoteliers, Minor International PCL MINT.BK and Central Plaza Hotel PCL CENT.BK, are benefiting from an expanding economy and a recovery from last year's flooding. Investors have pushed the shares to record highs.

CDL, which owns four- and five-star hotels in Singapore, reported weaker-than-expected results on Oct 30 and said its revenue per available room slipped to S$209 ($170) in the July-September quarter from S$217 in the previous three months. That was the highest rate since the second quarter of 2008, just before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy sparked a global recession that crushed hotel demand.
