He said the Pentagon also needed to stop making changes to the program, calling such moves destabilizing to an already complex program. Bogdan is no stranger to difficult programs, having led the Air Force's controversial effort to buy a new refueling plane, which eventually saw Boeing Co ( BA.N ) beat out Europe's EADS.

There's no further flexibility or tolerance for that approach," Donley said. The unusually public criticism of Lockheed's work on the F-35 program followed a "very painful" September 7 review that focused an array of ongoing program challenges. <ID:L1E8KA3OG> Lockheed responded with a brief statement, saying it would continue to work with the Pentagon's F-35 program office to deliver the new fighter.

"We remain committed to continuing our work to solve program challenges and build on the momentum and success we've achieved during the past couple of years," said spokesman Michael Rein. Bogdan, who joined the program five weeks ago and is slated to move into the top spot later this year, said the Pentagon needed to revamp its overall approach to the program even as it maintained pressure on Lockheed to improve its performance.

He said the program still had a significant amount of flight testing to do, having completed only about one-third of the required flight testing. There were also continuing issues with the plane's helmet, overall software development and the automated logistics system, Bogdan said, adding that the Pentagon was working closely with Lockheed to address those areas.

"Time is not on our side when it comes to the Marine IOC (initial operational capability)," Bogdan said. Bogdan said the program also had work to do on the F-35C-model being developed for use on board Navy aircraft carriers. He said a reworked tailhook system succeeded only five of eight times during flight tests earlier this year, but said he was confident that the issue would be fixed.
