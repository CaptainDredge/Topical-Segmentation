"It's about making sure people understand relationships, to make sure we strengthen the bonds between the adviser and the client," he said. Ludeman said he is not likely to pursue new acquisitions, focused first on integrating the many legacy operations early next year. BANKING ON BROKERS For now, Wells Fargo Advisers is targeting a relatively narrow customer segment: affluent clients with $250,000 to $1 million of investable assets and preferably those who also want to become Wells Fargo bank customers.

The wealth management industry in time will adopt a "barbell" shape, he said, with a few giants on one end, lots of boutiques on the other end and nothing in between. That said, Ludeman said he's working "harder than ever" to retain a small-company feel. Wells Fargo tracks information about its employees' personal and professional milestones, like recognizing a birthday or wedding anniversary.

Bank-owned brokerages have traditionally been dismissed by advisers working at independent boutiques or Wall Street firms. Conventional wisdom said highly paid, free-wheeling advisers did not mix with process-driven, risk-averse banks. The financial crisis, which put a premium on capital strength and cheap deposits, may have ended the era of large stand-alone brokerages.

Yet in his mind, Ludeman still runs a cozy little regional company. "We kind of cringe when people call us a wirehouse," Ludeman told Reuters. "We don't view ourselves that way." Ludeman, in an interview, outlined his strategy to marry the products and services of a big national company, while keeping the kind of small-company touch attractive to advisers and investors.

"And they're going after the low-hanging fruit among their own customers." Backed by the fourth-largest U.S. commercial bank, Ludeman said, Wells Fargo brokers can offer investments and services to clients that regional and boutique firms cannot match. "There are huge economies of scale in this business," Ludeman said. "With our scale and scope now, we can compete with anybody." Being big is also critical to being a long-term survivor.
