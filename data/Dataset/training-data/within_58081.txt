The auto giant did not give a breakdown of Hyundai and Kia sales target. In 2010, Hyundai Motor sold 3.6 million cars, up 16 percent, and Kia shipped 2.1 million vehicles, up 40 percent. "Hyundai Motor Group's 2011 target appears to be conservative and fully achievable," Tong Yang Securities analyst Ahn Sang-jun said.

"Hyundai will post lower volume growth this year, but still outperform the market. Hyundai does not want to be another Toyota which was hit by quality issues following fast volume expansion," Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said. "Although the South Korean currency remains a major factor, Hyundai's earnings are expected to improve this year on the back of new models, which will help increase selling prices." Hyundai said on Monday it would target sales of 6.33 million cars in 2011, up 10 percent from 5.75 million units sold in 2010.

Kia's total shipments also jumped 27.8 percent last month, helped by a 40 percent growth in foreign sales. Hyundai Motor gained market share in the United States last year, helped by strong sales of its Sonata mid-sized sedan, its best-selling model in America, while its new Avante compact showed a solid performance in the home market.

Indian automaker Tata Motors ( TAMO.BO ) said on Saturday its India sales rose 31 percent in December, while Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd ( MAHM.BO ) reported a 42 percent sales rise last month. Hyundai said its total sales rose 2.8 percent in December from a year ago, as a 11 percent rise in overseas sales counter the impact of a 21 percent drop in domestic sales.

Hyundai Motor plans to roll out 10 new models this year globally, including FS utility vehicle, which will be unveiled during the January's Detroit auto show. But limited production capacity is likely to keep Hyundai Motor from boosting output sharply, analysts said. Hyundai's factories are already running at nearly full capacity and the only major capacity addition is its Russian plant with an annual production capacity of 150,000 units.
