NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil prices were hovering to the firm side in choppy electronic trading Monday morning as traders weighed turmoil in Nigeria threatening output there while waiting for signs OPEC will implement its recent production cut."We're caught in a range recently and, with the possibility of more disruption of Nigerian production out there, along with skepticism about OPEC's ability to implement cuts, we're just waiting for something to break out of the range," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president, energy risk management, at Fimat USA.

The two were kidnapped from an oil industry ship off the southern Nigerian state of Bayelsa, one of Nigeria's top oil producing states. On Monday suspected militants invaded an oil production facility operated by Italian oil company Agip at Tebidaba in southern Nigeria, a government official said.

Analysts have expressed skepticism that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut the full amount. So far, only buyers of crude from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Algeria have confirmed those three members have made cuts totaling more than 500,000 bpd. Daukoru insisted the latest violence in Nigeria was a social rather than political issue and that a Briton and an American kidnapped in the area would be released soon.

But there will be normal temperatures on Monday, and above normal through Friday. Oil dealers have watched as crude was unable to break out of a range between the 2006 low of $56.55 hit October 20 and the October 26 high of $61.79. Markets will also eye Wednesday's fresh snapshot of U.S. oil inventories, after last week's data showed crude supply rebounded, along with imports, after slumping in the previous week's data.
