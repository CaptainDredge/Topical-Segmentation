But Hollande's Socialist government, in place since last month, has pledged to counter rising unemployment by making it prohibitively expensive for companies to lay off workers. To try to minimize the impact of the job cuts on a workforce of 70,000, partially state-owned Air France promised to avoid forced layoffs, encouraging early retirement, voluntary departures, part-time working and work-sharing.

PARIS  (Reuters) - Air France announced more than 5,000 job losses under a cost-cutting plan on Thursday, creating a political headache for new President Francois Hollande.The cuts at the French flag carrier, part of the loss-making Air France-KLM Group ( AIRF.PA ), come as the world's airline industry grapples with limited growth prospects, rising costs and fallout from the euro zone debt crisis.

The Air France job cuts are a blow to Hollande's government, which is fighting unemployment of 10 percent - its highest this century - and plans new rules to make it harder to fire workers. The government and unions fear a wave of layoffs from companies that did not want to make them during the politically sensitive election period.

Air France-KLM and Europe's other older carriers have been confronting losses in short-haul operations as the continent's economy has taken a battering. The Franco-Dutch group unveiled a three-year plan in January to reduce debt and operating costs by 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in an effort to break even in 2014.

Labour Minister Michel Sapin, who has said the government's aim is to "make layoffs so expensive for companies that it's not worth it", told Europe 1 radio on Thursday that he supported negotiations between management and unions to save Air France. "Management is saying that if nothing is done, this great company risks collapsing," Sapin said.
