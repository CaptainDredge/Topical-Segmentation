The Fed has faced intense scrutiny from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill for many of the extraordinary actions it has taken since the financial crisis erupted in the summer of 2007. After Bank of America's eventual decision to go through with its purchase of Merrill, the bank received a fresh injection of $20 billion in public funds and a government backstop on potential losses on a $118 billion pool of shaky assets.

So far, Obama has only said Bernanke has done a good job. Asked about the criticisms of Bernanke on Capitol Hill, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs reiterated on Thursday that the president has confidence in the Fed chief. Under questioning, Bernanke said several times that he could not remember the details of the conversation Lacker had referred to in his e-mail, but said, whatever the substance, he never threatened Lewis.

"I never did make a threat," the Fed chairman said. Bernanke also said he had not directed then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to threaten to fire management. However, the Fed chairman said that if Bank of America had invoked a merger-halting "material adverse change" clause and subsequently needed a government bailout, the company's leadership would likely have experienced a repercussion.

SYSTEMIC RISK ROLE QUESTIONED The probe into the merger comes as lawmakers debate an Obama administration plan for a regulatory overhaul that would expand the Fed's powers over the financial system. Some lawmakers said lingering questions over the Fed's role raised doubts about whether it should be given more power. Financial market participants watched the hearing with some anxiety that it signals a search for a scapegoat for the financial crisis and a possible erosion of political support for a Fed chairman who has earned high marks on Wall Street.

Bernanke, holding his ground, told the members of the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee the Fed never did anything "beyond the law or unethical." "I did not tell Bank of America's management that the Federal Reserve would take action against the board or management," he said. Bernanke also said neither he nor other Fed officials had "ever directed, instructed, or advised" the bank to withhold information about Merrill's mounting losses from the public, another charge lawmakers have leveled at the central bank.
