and NovaStar Financial Inc. are among other subprime lenders struggling with rising defaults. LAX STANDARDS U.S. homeowner delinquencies and defaults surged after many subprime lenders eased their lending standards too far. Some of the lenders offered low initial rates, which later jumped beyond what customers could afford, or even made loans that customers could not afford in the first place.

New Century stopped making loans, and at least 17 states told it to stop lending. The company said it has about 100,000 creditors. Larger creditors include Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Countrywide Financial Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, among others, court filings show. Lazard Freres & Co., AlixPartners LLP and the law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP are advising New Century.

It stopped making loans last month, after having made nearly $60 billion in 2006. "We are only at the very beginning of the problems facing subprime," said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Brad Hintz. "This liquidity crisis is continuing." New Century filed for protection from creditors with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware.

New Century was the largest independent U.S. provider of "subprime" mortgages, or home loans to people with poor credit histories. More than 30 rivals have sold or closed similar operations in the past year. The demise of New Century came less than two months after the company first disclosed problems with delinquent and defaulted loans.

The company's shares fell 14.5 cents to 91.5 cents on the Pink Sheets, but will probably be worthless following the reorganization. Morrice said subprime loans remain a viable product. "These loans have helped millions of Americans, many who might not otherwise have been able to access credit or to realize the benefits of home ownership," he said.
