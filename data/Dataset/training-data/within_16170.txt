In a sign that the long-term jobless continue to struggle to find work, the number of people remaining on benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid rose hit its highest since October 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

"We are having a lot of trouble in the labor market," said Lindsey Piegza, market analyst for FTN Financial in New York. "Generally, a 350,000 to 375,000 range is a recession warning zone, and we have to be there for about a month." The sharp jump in claims the previous week was skewed by the holiday-shortened workweek due to the Martin Luther King, Jr. federal holiday, a Labor Department official said.
