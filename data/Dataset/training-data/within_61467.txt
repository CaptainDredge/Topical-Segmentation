Ralls explained that the "option value" of old rigs sitting in the shipyard has decreased as the potential cost of revamping them up to standard has risen to tens of millions of dollars in some cases. "They're not all alike," said Mike Breard at Hodges Capital Management, adding that some older rigs are simply not capable of modern drilling techniques.

"The trade-off is really whether you can get enough for them to justify the expense to get them to the break-up yard," Ralls said. "Contractors are just slow to pull the trigger on that decision." Some older rigs even spend some of their twilight years as roving hotels for workers on other operations, such as the four jackups that Noble has doing "accommodation work" off Qatar.

"It used to be Mexico, though they're wanting to high-grade now," Ralls said. Pemex PEMX.UL demanded last year that rigs be less than 10 years old, but the state oil company appears to have eased up on that requirement recently. Breard at Hodges Capital said other buyers might be small independent players looking to work off areas such as Africa, which made even more sense now with oil prices so high.

NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - Growing demand for new offshore oil rigs, partly driven by the Gulf of Mexico spill last year, has led to a spurt of building in shipyards and raised tough questions about what to do with the old rigs.The average offshore drilling rig is now about a quarter of a century old and, despite having been upgraded, many of the older ones look more obsolete by the year.

Yet generally speaking, retirement is only a matter of time for outdated models. "At a certain point it just doesn't make any sense to upgrade them or put another 5-10 million bucks into them," said John Tasdemir, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "Better just to scrap them and either start over, or just do something else." (Reporting by Braden Reddall; editing by  Andre Grenon )
