Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers have been working with BNP. Goldman advised BNP in 1999 on its failed SocGen bid. Earlier this month French bank Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) also said that although it was not planning any major takeovers this year, it would monitor the situation regarding SocGen. Some analysts have speculated over a break-up of SocGen between BNP Paribas and Agricole, with BNP getting SocGen's retail bank and Agricole the investment banking division.

A source close to the matter said BNP Paribas came to its decision because of SocGen's opposition to any tie-up and as BNP would not make a hostile bid. In January BNP, which narrowly failed to buy SocGen in 1999, said it was looking at its rival. The source said uncertainty in financial markets over the credit crisis and the investigation into Kerviel also contributed to BNP's decision.

Despite calls from Sarkozy to resign, SocGen Chairman Daniel Bouton has remained in charge and last month he told Reuters he would continue with SocGen's standalone strategy. Although there has been no direct contact between SocGen and BNP, France's central bank has played a crucial role in stabilizing the situation and has been in touch with both sides.

BNP has a stock market value of around 55 billion euros. "It's obviously bad news for SocGen shareholders. Nevertheless, it was expected and we had anticipated it since BNP would not have taken that much time if it really wanted to make a bid," said Iris Finance fund manager Michael Sellam, who holds SocGen shares.

That, according to one source, gave SocGen Chairman Daniel Bouton ample opportunity to ensure Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer carried a clear message back to BNP: no deal. Bank mergers routinely need the blessing of central banks. SocGen this month completed a 5.5 billion euro rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet after the trading losses.
