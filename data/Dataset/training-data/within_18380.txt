The former Salomon Brothers executive is trying to assure investors that his firm will survive tough market conditions and preserve about $1.4 billion of assets, the newspaper said. "We have sharply reduced the risk and balance sheet of the portfolio," the letter said.

The Relative Value Opportunity fund had $14.90 in borrowed money for every $1 in equity as of the end of February, the newspaper said.
