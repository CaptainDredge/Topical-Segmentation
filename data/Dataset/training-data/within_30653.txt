In cash bond markets, 2012 debt from Hynix Semiconductor fell 5 points to 50 cents to the dollar after Fitch downgraded its ratings on the South Korean chip maker to B-plus from BB-minus, due to worsening profitability and financial condition. Tata Motors' bonds due in 2011 and 2012 were range-bound at 62.5 cents and 43 cents to the dollar respectively, even after Standard & Poor's on Friday downgraded the Indian auto maker to BB-minus from BB.

Spreads had widened on Friday after the U.S. Senate rejected a bailout plan for struggling auto makers, though those fears eased after the U.S. White House said later that day it would be willing to provide emergency aid. Still, plenty of uncertainty remains, including about the Federal Reserve policy meeting ending on Tuesday, as well as quarterly results from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both of which are expected to post substantial losses.

HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian bond spreads tightened on Monday on hopes that major U.S. auto makers may yet be rescued by the government though credit markets remain subdued ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting this week.Caution also prevailed after Ecuador declared a default on $3.8 billion worth of its sovereign bonds and refused to pay a $31 million interest payment due on Monday on its 2012 global bonds.

The action stems from the worsening outlook for the global car making sector, and comes after Moody's had downgraded Tata to B1 in late November, or one notch below S&P's new rating.

"Protection spreads are indicated tighter this morning in Asia," said Brett Williams, an analyst at BNP Paribas in an email to clients. "Wild price gyrations and volatility on thin trade flows exacerbate movements in CDS (credit default swaps) and basis. We recommend the sidelines for this market," he added. The Asia iTRAXX investment-grade index excluding Japan, a key measure of risk aversion, moved in by 20 basis points (bps) to around 385, erasing a sharp widening of more than 30 bps on Friday.
