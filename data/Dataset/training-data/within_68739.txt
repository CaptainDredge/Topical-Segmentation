(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday boosted its support for the U.S. economy with a $400 billion program designed to push down longer-term interest rates and support the housing market.The Fed will sell shorter-term notes and use those funds to purchase longer-dated securities for its $2.85 trillion balance sheet. It will also reinvest proceeds from maturing mortgage-backed securities back into the mortgage market, an acknowledgment of continued weakness in the housing sector.
