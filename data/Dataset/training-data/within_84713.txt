"Clearly they are trying to ... influence the sell-side analysts so we start saying, 'Oh maybe this deal will happen,' that source said. On Thursday, Schulze said a number of leading private equity firms had said they were prepared to make significant commitments, subject to due diligence. He still did not name the firms.

Schulze, who owns about one-fifth of Best Buy's shares, had said he planned to fund the deal through a combination of investments from private equity firms, reinvestment of about $1 billion of his own equity, and debt financing. On Thursday, he said he was willing to reinvest "potentially" all of his stake, depending on the terms of the agreements with his private equity partners.

<ID: nL2E8J88NY> Earlier this month, Schulze expressed an interest in buying the struggling retailer for $8.16 billion to $8.84 billion, or $24 to $26 a share. Including the assumption of Best Buy's debt, the total value would be $10.9 billion, making it the year's biggest leveraged buyout so far. Best Buy, which has called Schulze's proposal "highly conditional," said in an email to Reuters that its board would consider the letter "in due course." The board is unlikely to do anything significant about Schulze's offer until later this month, when it announces plans to transform the company, two sources close to the matter have told Reuters.

"I still hope to work with the board on a mutually beneficial transaction - but you should know that I am not going away," Schulze said in a letter to the board. The news came just days after sources told Reuters that several private equity firms that have been approached to join in a buyout of Best Buy were sitting on the fence, citing the lack of a tangible plan by Schulze and doubts about his ability to pull off the deal.

The unsolicited proposal comes as the company Schulze founded in 1966 struggles to compete with online and discount rivals and to reduce its own unwieldy size. Schulze's camp has also been reaching out privately to Wall Street analysts covering Best Buy to explain his side of the story, an analyst who requested anonymity told Reuters earlier this week.
