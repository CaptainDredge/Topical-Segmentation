EMI albums sold on iTunes will automatically be sold without the software and at the higher sound quality for the same price. The new higher quality DRM-free music will be in addition to EMI's existing range of standard DRM-protected downloads, which will still be available, EMI said at a press conference in central London with Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs.

LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - EMI is to make its music available online without a key anti-piracy measure, becoming the first major music group to take the risk in a bid to grow digital sales.Digital Rights Management or DRM was introduced to contain piracy by preventing users from making multiple copies, but its critics say it restricts consumers and therefore hinders the growth of legal downloading.

"Selling digital music DRM-free is the right step forward for the music industry," Jobs said on Monday. "We expect to offer more than half of the songs on iTunes in DRM-free versions by the end of the year. MORE CHOICE EMI said retailers would be offered downloads of tracks and albums in the DRM-free audio format from today.

There was no formal announcement regarding a Beatles deal, as some followers anticipated when EMI announced on Sunday that it would hold a press conference with Apple. "We are working on it," Nicol said, without giving a time frame. EMI has acted as the distributor for the Beatles since the early 1960s, but the Fab Four's music holding company Apple Corps Ltd.

Earlier this year, Jobs called on the world's four major record companies, including EMI, to start selling songs online without DRM copy-protection software. Jobs argued that there appeared to be no benefit for the record companies in selling more than 90 percent of their music without DRM on compact discs, while selling the remaining small percentage of music online encumbered with DRM.
