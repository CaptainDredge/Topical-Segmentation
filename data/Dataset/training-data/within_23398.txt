According to some measures, U.S. house prices have already fallen some 18 percent from their 2006 peak and many economists expect at least another 10 percent decline. PIMCO's McCulley also said it was the right course of action for the U.S. government to "backstop deflating assets" such as houses by supporting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

U.S. homes purchased in or after 2004 are now at risk of their mortgages turning "upside down" otherwise known as "negative equity," Gross noted. That is when the value a house can fetch falls below the mortgage the homeowner owes. Some 25 million U.S. homes are at risk of falling into negative equity, which in many cases results in foreclosures, Gross noted.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The best way to help the ailing U.S. housing market recover from the $1 trillion of losses it faces will be to cut the cost of mortgages via the U.S. housing bill and rescue package for mortgage finance giants, the manager of the world's biggest bond fund said on Thursday."Lowering the cost of mortgage credit via the omnibus housing/GSE bill now placed before the Congress and the president is the best way to begin the long journey back to normalcy," wrote Bill Gross, chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO) in his August Investment Outlook letter.

"For now, investors should remain in high-quality assets until -- until, well -- until the prospect for home prices points skyward or until the cows come home, whichever one's first," he wrote. A major problem the housing market now faces, Gross wrote, is that 30-year fixed mortgage rates are now higher than when the Federal Reserve began cutting the fed funds rate in September 2007.

"Asset price deflation in the context of deleveraging is, in my view, much more nefarious than modest goods and services price deflation, since asset price deflation undermines the capital base of levered financial intermediaries, begetting yet more deleveraging and further asset price deflation," McCulley added. Until the housing market reaches a bottom and U.S. home prices are headed higher, investors should stay in high-quality assets, wrote Gross, who manages the $130 billion PIMCO Total Return Fund.
