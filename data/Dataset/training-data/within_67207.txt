Li's speech, with its specific policy announcements, along with other recent substantive speeches from him appeared to signal that China's top leaders are preparing him for a larger role ahead of his widely expected promotion to premier in 2013. Li said foreign owners of yuan can soon buy up to 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) worth of yuan-denominated stocks and bonds on the mainland with the renminbi.

To anchor the yuan bond market, Li said Beijing is committed to selling Treasury bonds in Hong Kong. "Issuing renminbi treasury bonds in Hong Kong will be a long term institutional arrangement of the central government," Li said. "We will gradually increase the size of insurance and work for the development and improvement of the renminbi bond market in Hong Kong," he said.

To that end, China wants firms to not just rely on the U.S. currency when settling trade. China's experiment with using Hong Kong as a place outside the mainland where the yuan can trade, and as a test bed where capital controls can be gradually eased, has met with great success.

"By opening up a significant channel for yuan inflows back to onshore asset markets, (it is) closing the circle for the global circulation of China's currency," the bank said. Indeed, Li made clear that China is ready to provide Hong Kong with more investment avenues for its yuan deposits. He said mainland companies are now allowed to sell bonds in the territory, a shift from before when only financial companies could issue bonds in Hong Kong.

Li's remarks came as China sold 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) of bonds in its biggest-ever issue, adding depth to a fast-growing market. "It's all very positive," Bonn Liu, a partner-in-charge at KPMG China Capital Markets, said of Li's announcements. "It's a step out for the yuan." Below is a list of plans outlined by Li: -- China to launch RMB QFII which would allow foreign investors to invest in mainland securities with initial quota size of 20 billion yuan -- China to promote Hong Kong as offshore yuan trading center -- China to further open up services sector to Hong Kong -- China to expand yuan trade settlement scheme nationwide -- China to allow Hong Kong firms to directly invest in mainland China using the yuan -- China to expand Treasury bond sales in Hong Kong -- China to launch in ETF linked to Hong Kong stocks in mainland China -- China to let Hong Kong insurers set up branches in mainland China, take stakes in mainland insurance firms -- China to study possibility of letting Hong Kong participate in China's existing free trade agreements -- China's flagship West-East gas pipeline to start supplying gas to Hong Kong in 2012 ($1 = 6.383 Chinese Yuan) (Additional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Donny Kwok and Alison Leung; Writing by Koh Gui Qing; Editing by Chris Lewis and  Ken Wills )
