It is in a way normal behavior when certain perceptions crystallize...and it is acting here." "In a way it was to be expected when these situations crystallize that there is overshooting...They are volatile trying to see what will be the final outcome and the final response to the problem because a response is necessary.

which we have been doing." "For general reasons, not because of Ireland, we are in full allotment mode in providing liquidity and this has been very helpful of course for the Irish banks." "That is the final support to be expected by a central bank and... We have been fulfilling our role there." ON STEPPING UP BOND PURCHASES "That is a matter for further consideration, but as you know we don't precommit or even announce the type of policy that we pursue with the Securities Market Programme." "You only have after each week the total amount that has been used, as you have seen that is according to developments in the market, in particular in passing a judgment on whether such developments can have some economic justification in the fundamentals of the economy or not." "The program is still there and you have seen that in the more recent weeks in view of developments we have used a little bit more than in recent months." ON GREECE "There are two elements there (Greece)...in the first place the results for this year are in big part the result of the fact that the deficit of 2009 has been revised up."
