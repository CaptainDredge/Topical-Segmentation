The company has lost $16 billion in its European operations over the last 12 years - a figure the No. 1 U.S. automaker could even top in the next 12 according to Jonas. GM is scrambling to cut losses, introduce new cars and realign its business in that region, including forming an alliance with French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ).

"Despite the tough environment for the automotive business in Europe, we believe we have an opportunity to turn the Opel/Vauxhall business around and bring it back to long-term profitability," GM spokesman Jim Cain said. GM's shares were up more than 4 percent, or 91 cents, to $22.67 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

"Opel isn't merely a drain on precious cash," Jonas said. "It is a drain on engineering resources, management resources -- sapping energy and swagger from the culture of the company." Morgan Stanley's investment banking arm has advised GM in the past. Exiting Opel would cost GM between $7 billion and $13 billion, including $3 billion to $7 billion in cash GM would likely need to attach to the business to sell it, Jonas estimated, adding the figure could even be higher.

Opel has been a drag on GM's results, leading the automaker to push for changes including the ouster of the unit chief executive in July. In 2009, GM almost sold Opel to Magna before pulling out of the deal after deciding Opel was too strategic a part of its global business.

At the time, GM CEO Dan Akerson had favored the sale, but has stressed in recent months that he is not focused on the past but fixing Opel today. Jonas speculated GM "wishes they had a 'do-over' on the 2009 sale. Jonas called Opel the "single biggest threat to GM's long-term financial health and sustainability," adding that a separation was in the best interest of not only GM but Opel as well.
