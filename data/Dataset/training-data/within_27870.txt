PNC said the purchase would make it the fifth-largest U.S. bank by deposits. The acquisition roughly doubles PNC's size. In Friday trading, PNC shares closed up 3.5 percent at $58.88, while National City fell 24.7 percent to $2.07. Among other companies, JPMorgan fell 6.4 percent to $35.43; Citigroup dropped 7.4 percent to $12.14; Bank of America, which is buying Merrill, shed 8.4 percent to $21.07; Goldman ended down 7.5 percent at $100.40; Merrill slid 9.4 percent to $15.86; and Morgan Stanley fell 8.6 percent to $16.52.

BB&T Corp rose 6.8 percent to $32.25, while U.S. Bancorp gained 2.7 percent to $29.45. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp had looked into buying National City, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. One of Friday's biggest decliners was Fifth Third Bancorp, whose shares slid 28.7 percent to $8.07. The Cincinnati lender has also seen loan losses mount, and been thought to be a takeover target, perhaps for PNC.

Credit losses at most major U.S. lenders are soaring, often to three times or more than year-ago levels. The losses are likely to rise if housing prices fall further, unemployment rises, and the economy deteriorates, causing more retail and business customers to have trouble paying their bills. National City, a Cleveland-based bank battered by soured mortgage and construction loans in the U.S. Midwest and Florida, agreed to be acquired by PNC in a transaction valuing it at just $2.23 per share, 19 percent below where it closed on Thursday and 94 percent below where it traded in March 2007.

"This is a difficult environment," James Rohr, chief executive of Pittsburgh-based PNC, said on a conference call. "The economy has been deteriorating quarter by quarter." National City had lost money in five straight quarters. It joins Bear Stearns Cos, Merrill Lynch & Co, Sovereign Bancorp Inc, Wachovia Corp and Washington Mutual Inc among financial companies that were swallowed up this year by lenders considered healthier.

PNC and Tennessee's First Horizon National Corp said on Friday they will obtain infusions. Capital One Financial Corp and SunTrust Banks Inc were among banks on the Treasury list, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. Treasury is also examining how to give help to insurers under its $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, two people familiar with the deliberations said.
