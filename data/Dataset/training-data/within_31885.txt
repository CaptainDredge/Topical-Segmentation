Pandit turned 52 on Wednesday. On Tuesday Citigroup announced plans to combine its Smith Barney brokerage and other units with Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit.

"At Citigroup, the government has far more influence than on any other bank in the industry, and that's why there may be more force to bear there." OUT OF TIME?

While the transaction would bolster Citigroup's balance sheet and result in a $5.8 billion gain, the decline in the bank's stock resembled the downdraft last November 17-21, the week before Citigroup got the second TARP infusion. Shares fell 60.4 percent that week, including 20 percent on Friday. "We continue to be concerned that weakness in Citigroup's share price may lead to lack of customer (or government) confidence," Barclays Capital analyst Jason Goldberg wrote on Wednesday.
