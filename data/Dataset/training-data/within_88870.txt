"All these rules are designed to stop misuse of information for trading. This does not raise market regulation issues." With various regulators looking at the Facebook listing, Galvin is the first to come out with a fine, albeit a small one. Gavin has long had a reputation of being an aggressive regulator who has filed suit against Wall Street's top banks for securities law violations.

Gavin said the Citi case was completed first because his office was able to obtain emails showing how the analysts broke the rules. Some market participants questioned whether the Citi analysts' actions were that bad. They noted that Mahaney has consistently received high marks in surveys of institutional investors. Citi fired Mahaney and the junior analyst, and said it was pleased that the matter with Massachusetts has been resolved.

The state's top securities regulator, William Galvin, charged Citigroup Global Markets Inc with breaking Massachusetts securities laws that prohibit analysts at underwriting firms from sending "written research or other written content" until 40 days after Facebook's IPO. He would not say how close his office might be to charging any other firms, or what kind of evidence they may have.

One of the most respected Internet analysts on Wall Street, Mahaney had already been in trouble with his bosses for sharing information with journalists. On April 11, Citi's director of research for the Americas sent Mahaney a "letter of education," noting that he had broken the bank's rules when he spoke to journalists at Bloomberg and the New York Times without first obtaining legal approval, according to the complaint.

FACEBOOK DEBACLE After Facebook's debut, smaller investors were outraged to learn about the Morgan Stanley's conference calls that they felt gave an edge to its big clients. The head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street's self-regulator, said not long after the May 18 Facebook debut that allegations surrounding Morgan Stanley's conference calls were a matter of "regulatory concern." FINRA declined to comment further on Friday.
