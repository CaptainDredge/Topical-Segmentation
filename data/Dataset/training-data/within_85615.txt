"We've been trading in Europe for years, so we have a deep understanding of carbon right now," said Anthony D'Agostino, director of emissions markets for the Royal Bank of Canada. "To replicate this in California is a no-brainer for us," he said. Although it does not have a long history in emissions markets, Canada-based Scotiabank is the most active bank in the market at this point, with a client roster of oil companies and utilities that represent over half the state's carbon emissions.

Jason Patrick led Merrill Lynch's U.S. environmental products desk until the Bank of America-owned bank closed it down last March. But he opted to stay in the young market anyway, helping launch a new company, Real Options International, to assist clients navigating the complexities of the California carbon market, in addition to other environmental and energy markets.

The carbon market's success or failure will sway U.S. environmental policy for years to come, and early-moving Canadian banks like Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) and the Royal Bank of Canada, as well European banks like Deutsche Bank and Barclays, could play a critical role in that outcome. Banks facilitate the purchases and sales of carbon credits for their clients, advise company executives on how to keep their costs down, and ultimately help them meet their environmental goals.

Policy changes helped prices to recover for a time, only to fall again back when it became clear that the market was oversupplied with permits. Even though prices are currently hovering just above all-time lows, emissions in the EU region have come down. While some argue the economic recession is the primary driver of those reductions, many environmentalists claim the program has also played a significant role in the drop.

Much of the exchange-based action has been driven by Houston-based trading desks, which already trade western power and that have simply added California carbon to their portfolios. The modest trading is expected to ramp up steadily following the November 14 allowance auction as natural buyers like utilities and oil refineries start looking for permits.
