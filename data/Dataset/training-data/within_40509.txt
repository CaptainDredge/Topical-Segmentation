Solid profits from the likes of BNP, HSBC ( HSBA.L ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) have led some to think that the worst of the financial crisis might be over. SocGen said in a statement that while the economic outlook remained uncertain, there were signs that market conditions were becoming more stable.

SOME STILL SCEPTICAL Despite Thursday's share price rise, SocGen's stock has underperformed many other European banks. The stock has risen 35 percent so far this year -- less than the 43 percent gain in the DJ Stoxx European bank index .SX7P. "SocGen's results are a mixed picture," said Agilis Gestion fund manager Arnaud Scarpaci, whose firm manages around 100 million euros of assets.

DETERMINED TO STAY INDEPENDENT SocGen has been treading the path to recovery since getting caught in the trading scandal of 19 months ago, which it blamed on unauthorized deals carried out by Jerome Kerviel, a former junior trader at the bank. Kerviel remains under formal investigation for breach of trust, computer abuse and falsification.

"The bad debt charge remains a cause for concern," he said, adding that he preferred BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) shares to SocGen. The world's top banks have so far produced a mixed set of results. Earlier this week BNP Paribas, France's biggest bank by market capitalization, posted higher second-quarter profits while UBS ( UBSN.VX ) reported a loss.

PARIS  (Reuters) - Unexpectedly modest bad debt provisions and an investment banking recovery cushioned Societe Generale against steep falls in second quarter profits and the French bank said there were signs of stabler market conditions ahead.SocGen ( SOGN.PA ) said on Wednesday that net income fell 52 percent from last year to 309 million euros, well above the average estimate of 97 million euros from a Reuters poll of 15 analysts and bouncing back from a first-quarter loss of 278 million.
