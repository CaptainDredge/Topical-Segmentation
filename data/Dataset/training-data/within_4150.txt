In addition, analysts had anticipated productivity would be revised down after fourth-quarter economic growth was trimmed back, while U.S. employment stayed strong. Other data released on Tuesday showed U.S. chain store sales slipped 0.4 percent in the week ending March 3 but were up 1.5 percent year-on-year, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities.

This trimmed productivity gains for 2006 as a whole to 1.6 percent, the weakest rise since a matching pace set in 1997. The slippage also sent unit labor costs, a gauge of inflation and profit pressure watched closely by the Fed, up by a hefty 6.6 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.

You have a lot of noise based on the variability with the bonuses and profit-based compensations," said Keith Hembre at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis. Federal Reserve officials worry slowing productivity could push up wage inflation amid tight labor markets. But they also have said that the decline will probably prove to be a temporary, cyclical phenomenon, and do not see it as a warning that the United States is losing its competitive edge.

U.S. Treasury bond prices declined over the session in the face of an advancing stock market and largely ignored the data, which included a warning that manufacturers might hold back from spending while waiting for signs of stronger demand. "That's what got the market more excited, that there may be a more broad-based slowdown in business activity, which could transfer into (weaker) employment," said Cary Leahey at Decision Economics in New York.

For the year as a whole, unit labor costs rose 3.2 percent, the largest gain since 2000. "This data will likely continue to keep the Fed focused on the risks of rising inflation. Labor costs make up close to 70 percent of total firm costs," economists at Lehman Brothers wrote in a note to clients.
