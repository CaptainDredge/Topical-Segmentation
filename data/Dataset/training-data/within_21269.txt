Unquestionably, regulation needs to respond to what we have learned about the importance of primary dealers and their vulnerabilities to liquidity pressures." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, June 5: "The danger is that the effect of recent credit extension on the incentives of financial market participants might induce greater risk taking, which in turn could give rise to more frequent crises, in which case it might be difficult to resist further expanding the scope of central bank lending." "Our supervisory oversight and ability to constrain institutions that could put us in that situation needs to be better aligned.

We have worked with lenders and servicers to encourage appropriate modifications of distressed mortgage loans, and we have proposed new rules to improve disclosure and to ban unfair or deceptive acts and practices in mortgage lending. We are also collaborating with other regulators, both domestically and abroad, to put in place changes that will help make the financial system less vulnerable in the future.

Among the changes we expect to see are strengthening of capital and liquidity rules, greater disclosure requirements, an increased emphasis on the measurement and management of firm-wide risks, and further steps to increase the transparency and resilience of the financial infrastructure.

"Given what has happened, we need to have responsibility and authority that is better aligned with the scope of lending that we are going to be called upon to do." PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, JUNE 5: "Policy interventions in financial markets run the risks of increasing moral hazard and inhibiting efficient price discovery." "Moreover, interventions intended to quell instability can, by creating moral hazard, actually make instability more severe in the long run." "Specifying in advance the conditions or states of the world under which the central bank will lend is an essential first step." CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, June 3: "We are taking action in our role as regulators.

The Federal Reserve should play a central role in such a framework, working closely with supervisors in the U.S. and in other countries." VICE CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, June 5: "The existence of liquidity facilities at the central bank can undermine normal incentives for maintaining liquidity buffers, and the more extensive the access, the greater the degree to which market discipline will be loosened and prudential regulation will need to be tightened.
