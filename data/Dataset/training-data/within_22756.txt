This is obviously not good news for equities and markets are a little jittery to say the least as evidenced by the absolute trashing of anything to do with mortgage stocks. It's not good news for the dollar, it's not good news for equities. I don't know what's what going to convince it (the government) the save Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae right now."  CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW  YORK: "Initially, equities are selling off and bonds are rallying I guess just because it's not concrete enough from what the headlines are saying." "I think people want something more explicit, which maybe will happen over the weekend."  BRET BARKER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, METROPOLITAN WEST ASSET  MANAGEMENT, LOS ANGELES: "While Paulson is making supportive comments to the GSEs, there was no suggestion of any imminent bailout -- nor enough specifics to the support they would give.

This is a storm the likes of which this country hasn't seen." "Paulson's comments were much anticipated by the market. The market right now needs to see results. It no longer gives anyone the benefit of the doubt."
