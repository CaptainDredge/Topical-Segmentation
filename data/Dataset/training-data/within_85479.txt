ATLANTA/CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - Encana Corp ( ECA.TO ) said on Wednesday an internal investigation has determined that it did not collude with Chesapeake Energy Corp ( CHK.N ) to lower the price of land acquisitions in Michigan two years ago.The company's board of directors, which led the investigation launched on June 25 with the assistance of outside attorneys, did not provide a report on the scope of the inquiry, nor explain how it reached its conclusion.

Chesapeake then disclosed last month that it had received a subpoena from the Justice Department on June 29 as part of a grand jury investigation. The company also said it had received requests for documentation from "state governmental agencies" as part of other investigations of its land acquisitions. Encana's internal investigation was headed by David O'Brien, the chairman of Encana's board of directors.

It said it will fully cooperate with the two agencies. In June, Reuters reported that Encana plotted with rival Chesapeake Energy Corp to suppress land prices in Michigan two years ago. The report uncovered emails showing that the two natural gas companies repeatedly discussed how to avoid bidding against each other in a public land auction in Michigan and in nine prospective deals with private land owners in the state.

Most of the emails reviewed by Reuters were between top Chesapeake and Encana executives such as a June 15, 2010 email between Douglas Jacobson, Chesapeake's executive vice president for acquisitions and divestitures, and John Schopp, a vice president for Encana USA. In that email, Jacobson said he wanted to discuss the companies' proposed joint-venture and "the implications of the impact of our competition on acreage prices and whether or not the sooner we do this the better shot we have of keeping acreage prices from continuing to push up." Four months later, Chesapeake Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon and Encana USA President Jeff Wojahn discussed a "cooperative approach to state leasing," according to an October 17, 2010 email from McClendon.

The executives' subordinates traded proposals to divide up nine Michigan counties for bidding purposes ahead of a state land auction in October 2010. On October 20, six days before the auction, Encana's Wojahn wrote in an email to McClendon: "From what I understand John Schopp has been leading the charge on working with your team on arranging a bid strategy." A Reuters analysis showed land prices at the October state land auction were markedly lower than an earlier auction in May 2010 and neither Chesapeake nor Encana acquired acreage in the same counties as the rival company.
