The other problem is that easy money chasing high-yielding assets drives hot money into the emerging world, fans inflation and triggers monetary tightening which in turn slows growth -- creating a vicious circle. "If QE3 is simply a repeat of QE2, I don't think it has a positive impact that has sustainability," said Bob Janjuah, head of tactical asset allocation at Nomura.

As benefits wane, many fear the cost of repeated QE operations could be self-defeating in that more money printing fuels inflation, debases the currency and ultimately raises the government's borrowing costs. According to Jen, the Fed's balance sheet has grown by 10 points to 18 percent of GDP in two years - a similar scale to Japan's in the five years to 2006.

"(It) will make a commodity problem even worse. It won't help the economy but create a much bigger inflationary pressure. QE3 will force one globally positive growth area, emerging markets, to slow down because of inflation ... We could end up with a negative effect." Janjuah's preconditions for QE3 are a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate above 10 percent and a 20-25 percent fall in the S&P 500 index.

If it doesn't give a sustained boost to financial markets and is ambiguous for the real economy, is there any point? "We have a negative opinion of QE2, and believe QE3 could very well turn out to be ineffective at best, and counter-productive at worst," said Stephen Jen, managing partner of London-based hedge fund SLJ Partners.

But the effect of ample dollar liquidity spreads beyond the United States, largely because emerging economies either are pegged to the dollar or have inflexible exchange rate policies. Even economies that do allow their currencies to appreciate are at risk of asset bubbles as cheap money seeks higher yields. This means these fast-growing emerging economies effectively import the Fed's monetary easing and lift their demand for oil and commodities, whose prices also tend to rise on a weaker dollar.
