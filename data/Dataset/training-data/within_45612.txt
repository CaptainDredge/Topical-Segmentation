Delta Air Lines and American Airlines are both courting JAL with offers of capital and close cooperation on international routes. Following are some questions and answers about JAL's restructuring: WHAT IS THE LIKELY PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE JAL? JAL applied in October for help from the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp of Japan (ETIC), a body of specialists which can draw on state-backed funding to invest in and buy ailing firms' debt.

The ETIC is planning for JAL to file for bankruptcy some time between January 19 and 22. The ETIC would announce its plan to support the carrier on the same day as the bankruptcy filing. WHO WOULD BE HURT BY A JAL BANKRUPTCY, WHO MIGHT GAIN? JAL's top creditors are the state-owned Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) and units of Japan's top-three lenders, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG).

The prospect of that helped drive JAL shares down 45 percent on Tuesday, leaving it with a market value of $1.1 billion. Domestic rival All Nippon Airways (ANA) is the likely winner from a JAL bankruptcy. ETIC estimates JAL's revenues could drop 10 percent in the year from April and another 5 percent the following year after a bankruptcy filing.

WHERE'S THE SOFT LANDING? The ETIC is planning to put about 300 billion yen in fresh capital into JAL, while also preparing a credit line of more than 600 billion yen along with the DBJ to provide loans to keep JAL flying while it works through bankruptcy. The fund would also guarantee payment on fuel, parts and other commercial deals to reassure JAL's suppliers and partners.

JAL had said it would decide this month on whether to remain with American in the Oneworld alliance or switch to rival SkyTeam with Delta. The CEOs of both U.S. carriers have pitched in person to Japan's transport minister. But Seiji Maehara said on Friday the deadline would be tough. A decision may have to wait until JAL names a new chief executive to replace Haruka Nishimatsu, who has said he'll stand down once a restructuring plan is in place.
