For example, crude oil traded in New York is down 14 percent so far this month. The drop in commodity prices could be welcomed news for lower- to middle-income consumers in a two-pronged economy where they have been steadfastly frugal, while the upper-income shopper spends.

"I've really always been looking for a bargain, but on a high-end thing, it's going to have to be a bigger bargain to be able to make the purchase," Melanie Yoder, 40, a nurse from Chicago who works in the medical devices industry, said of how her behavior has changed since the 2008/2009 recession.

As growth slows, demand for oil and other commodities wanes, sending prices lower.

Yoder, who was leaving a Saks store on Michigan Avenue with a Saks shopping bag on Monday as the Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  was falling 6.6 percent, may be disappointed by the discounts this time around. Retailers have grown more accustomed to keeping inventories lean and cutting costs, which could keep top-tier stores like Saks from having to result to the bargain-basement discounts of the last recession.
