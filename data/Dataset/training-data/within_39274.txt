This influx will serve Asia well as it needs skilled managers to leverage further growth, experts say. "These returnees would serve as a bridge between Asia and the rest of the economies," said Irvin Seah, an economist at Singapore's DBS, Southeast Asia's largest bank. "With the exposure they had in Western economies and their local knowledge, they will be able to fill the human capital gap in Asia and significantly contribute to Asia's growth." The average Asian returnee nowadays is in his or her 30s, has a masters or doctorate degree, and comes from the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields, according to Vivek Wadhwa, a researcher at Harvard Law School's Labor and Worklife Program.

"We're constantly replacing expats with Asian returnees, people from their home countries who have been somewhat Westernized in business practices or business culture," said Ames Gross, president of Pacific Bridge, a U.S.-based recruitment firm that specializes in matching returnees to Asia-based firms. Wages in developing Southeast Asian countries may be around 25 percent of those in the West, Gross said, but the wage gap for professionals is narrowing.
