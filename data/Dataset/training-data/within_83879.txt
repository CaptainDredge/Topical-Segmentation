Standard & Poor's downgraded its debt to BBB in May and Moody's put it on review for downgrade. The company, which needs to raise 7-8 billion euros a year through 2015 to cope with debt maturities, said preliminary talks with ratings agencies showed they welcomed the move. If it lost its investment grade rating, raising such massive sums would be harder and cost more.

It hopes to raise up to 1.5 billion euros from the sale of call centre business Atento and other units. But liquidity pressures beyond next year mean the company could still have to do more. "At best, these will further reduce cash payments to shareholders, at worst they could require further asset disposals," said Ian Kelly, fund manager on the Schroder ISF European Dividend Maximiser, which does not currently hold stock in Telefonica.

Telefonica's 0.75 euro per share payout in 2013, halved from the previously announced 1.5 euro per share, will still give a dividend yield of 8.6 percent, higher than the sector average of 8.1 percent, according to Deutsche Bank. Telefonica, which made its dividend announcement along with the surprise early release of its first-half results on Wednesday, also said it would slash salaries by 20 percent for board members and around 30 percent for top management.

Telefonica has already paid out around 2.8 billion euros in dividends this year, and should save around 4.2 billion euros compared with 2011 by scrapping remaining payments. GOING FURTHER? Analysts welcomed Telefonica's plan as prudent but also underlined the company had little choice, given the severity of its situation. "They've done what shareholders, the markets in general and credit rating agencies were asking them to do," said Ivan San Felix, an analyst at Renta4 in Madrid.
