The stock has more than tripled since Michael Kors went public in December 2011. "Michael Kors is bringing more excitement to the category where people are buying new handbags, instead of other items like clothing," Citi analyst Oliver Chen told Reuters. Designer Michael Kors launched his brand 30 years ago as a luxury sportswear house.

Kors, well-known for his work as a judge on the long-running television fashion show "Project Runway", held a 3.7 percent stake in the company as of December 31. At today's share price, this stake would be worth around $466 million. The company, which reported third-quarter results that comfortably beat Wall Street estimates, said the addition of new stores and the conversion of department store premises into branded "shop-in-shops" had drawn in more customers.

Net income rose fourfold to $130.0 million, or 64 cents per share, from $32.0 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 41 cents per share. Revenue jumped 70 percent to $636.8 million in the quarter ended December, compared with $540.3 million forecast by analysts. "I think its sales trends will continue," said Swinand of Morningstar.

Comparable-store sales in Europe rose 58 percent in the third quarter, the company said. "Their fashion angle is quite attractive and I feel Europeans respond to the fashion credibility that Michael Kors has," Chen said. Chief Executive Idol said he expected Europe to be a $500 million market in which the company would open 100 stores.

He said he expected the global luxury market to keep growing at the same pace, without specifying a timeframe. The Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study of 2012 estimated that the global luxury goods market would grow to between $314 billion and $327 billion in 2015 from $251 billion in 2011. The lure of a new brand in the market has also driven growth for Michael Kors in the relatively weak European market.
