SAN FRANCISCO/ BOSTON  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O said on Thursday it plans to start selling personal computers through Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) in North America next month, breaking from a 23-year model of direct sales as it tries to rekindle business.Dell, which called the move a "first step" into the retail market, will start selling the computers bundled with accessories for under $700 starting June 10.

"Wal-Mart is known for its very tight supply chain, and Dell is also very good at that," said Wu of American Technology Research. At Dell, "margins are going to be tough," he added. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor index .SOXX slid 1.6 percent. Shares of Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) the world's largest chip maker and a major microprocessor supplier to Dell, dropped 3.1 percent to $21.97.

The world's largest retailer will sell two models of Dell's Dimension multimedia desktop computer, which are now available directly from the computer maker. "They (Dell) need to go retail and they are finally doing it," said Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research who has a "neutral" rating on Dell shares and does not own any.

"This is a first foray into the world of retail" for Dell, Gownder said. "It's not a bad move. But in the long run, they'll want to establish a more-sophisticated retail strategy." BREAKING TRADITION Since its founding in 1984, Dell has sold computers directly to customers through the mail, phone orders or the Internet.

( BBY.N ) Dell shares closed down 37 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $25.89 after earlier gaining as much as 1.7 percent. U.S. stocks fell amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates this year. The combination of Wal-Mart, famous for low prices, and Dell's Dimension desktops, the company's lowest-priced consumer models, may deter some upscale buyers, said J.P. Gownder, an industry analyst at market researcher Forrester Research Inc.
