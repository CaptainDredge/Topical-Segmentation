Oil had closed more than $2 a barrel lower on Wednesday, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported U.S. crude inventories rose 2.9 million barrels. <EIA/S> Inventories of crude oil have swelled since the start of the economic crisis last autumn as global energy demand dipped for the first time in a quarter century.

Oil's gains Thursday came after a U.S. report showing the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell for a third straight week, indicating some loss of force in the pace of the job market's deterioration. The data contributed to a rally on Wall Street of about 1 percent.

Concerns over weak demand and rising inventories have led producer group OPEC to agree to 4.2 million barrels per day worth of crude oil output cuts since September. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi has said OPEC would wait until crude inventories fall to around 53 days of forward cover -- nearly 10 days below current levels -- before considering raising output again.
