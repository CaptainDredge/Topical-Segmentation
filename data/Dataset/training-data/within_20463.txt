I sincerely hope you heed the wishes of your shareholdersand move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft,thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary. Sincerely yours, CARL C. ICAHN                      SLATE BIOGRAPHIES Lucian Bebchuk - The William J.

I have therefore taken thefollowing actions: (1) During the last 10 days, I havepurchased approximately 59 million shares and share-equivalentsof Yahoo; (2) I have formed a 10-person slate which will standfor election against the current board; and (3) I have soughtantitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission toacquire up to approximately $2.5 billion worth of Yahoo stock.The biographies of the members of our slate are attached tothis letter.

It isirresponsible to hide behind management's more than overlyoptimistic financial forecasts. It is unconscionable that youhave not allowed your shareholders to choose to accept an offerthat represented a 72% premium over Yahoo's closing price of$19.18 on the day before the initial Microsoft offer. I andmany of your shareholders strongly believe that a combinationbetween Yahoo and Microsoft would form a dynamic company andmore importantly would be a force strong enough to compete withGoogle on the Internet.
