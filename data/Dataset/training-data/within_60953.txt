Moreover, intervention is one way for the G7 to show solidarity with Japan as it struggles to cope with the disaster. G7 USUALLY WINS History is on the side of G7 central banks when they take on the currency markets together, as can be seen from this graphic of how currencies traded in the years after episodes of joint central bank intervention:  r.reuters.com/hec68r  .

The G7 countries are using their own money and this should eventually convince the market they mean business." ARM WRESTLING MARKETS The case for coordinated intervention was strengthened by the scale of the yen's rise on Thursday and the signals from the derivatives market, where implied yen volatilities soared.

Allowing the yen to rise beyond the record high of 76.25 per dollar set on Thursday would compound the problems facing Japanese exporters, whose production has been severely disrupted by last week's earthquake and the ensuing nuclear crisis. It is not in the interests of other G7 countries to allow Japan's economy to contract even more sharply than is already likely.

That means that any central bank intervening to weaken its currency has its work cut out if it is simultaneously raising interest rates. This is definitely not the case in Japan, which is printing money. Moreover, any yen sold in the currency markets are not going to be reabsorbed via money market operations -- that is, left unsterilized in the parlance of the currency markets.

Nothing the G7 nations have said or done so far suggests they are trying to weaken the yen to any particular level. But now they have shown their hand, they will be determined to stabilize the yen and avoid moves which would have severe repercussions for Japan's economy. "Rather than taking the market on in an arm-wrestling competition to get dollar/yen to a much higher level, they will try to bring it back to where it was," said Simon Smollett, senior foreign exchange options strategist at Calyon.
