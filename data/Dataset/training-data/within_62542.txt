Deutsche Bank's investment bank unit delivered the lion's share of group pretax profit -- 2.6 billion euros of a total 3 billion -- thanks to strong revenue from rates, money markets, foreign exchange and commodities trading. That was a far stronger performance than rivals. Investment banking profits fell by a third from a year ago at UBS, a quarter at Credit Suisse and by 15 percent at Barclays.

FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank posted near record first-quarter profit, driven by investment banking market share gains and acquisitions in retail banking and wealth management.The additions made in the wake of the financial crisis, including retail lender Deutsche Postbank and wealth manager Sal. Oppenheim, helped offset a slight fall in profit from investment banking.

But even in this area Deutsche performed better than peers, seeing profit dip 5 percent from a bumper year-ago period, but rise to more than three times the previous quarter. The first-quarter result lifted confidence that Germany's biggest lender can hit its ambitious 10 billion euro ($14.67 billion) pretax profit target this year.

Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause said the German lender had a long-term goal to generate around half of group profits from investment banking, with the other half coming from retail banking, asset and wealth management. EARNING FEES Thanks to recent acquisitions, Deutsche Bank's private clients and asset management section division posted a record pretax profit of 978 million euros, more than five times its year ago level.

U.S. peers have also seen revenue rise from the fourth quarter, but fall from the strong year-ago. Deutsche Bank made a push in debt advisory and capital raising, with revenues in equity origination jumping 56 percent as it cemented its grip on company listings -- an area rivals such as UBS slipped up in during the first quarter.
