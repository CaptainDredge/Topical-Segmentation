More than 100 second-tier cities have populations with more than 1 million people and consumers in these cities have both the buying power of their tier-one peers and an interest in luxury brands, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. China's consumption of luxury goods is forecast to grow 18 percent annually to about $27.51 billion by 2015, from about $12.23 billion in 2010, according to McKinsey.

"You can't find anything similar at other international labels," said Kwok, describing his Shanghai Tang purchase. "It's not about price, but availability."

Brands such as Shanghai Tang, part of Richemont Group ( CFR.VX ), and Hermes ( HRMS.PA ), which launched its China-focused label Shang Xia late last year, may have a head start in meeting changing appetites, analysts say. Local brands such as jeweler Qeelin, crowned the "Tiffany's of China," meanwhile, are gaining in popularity.

While Hermes has first-mover advantage with Shang Xia, which means "up down" in Mandarin, China's increasing rate of urbanization, disposable income and well-informed luxury consumers illustrate the opportunities that still exist, says Brenda Wang, founder of Hong Kong-based consultancy BrandXcel, which advises luxury and fashion brands planning to enter the Chinese market.

The typical luxury consumer in China has an average age of 39, is exposed to an international lifestyle and is increasingly proud to be Chinese, Wang said. "With these dynamics in play and in particular for those sophisticated consumers who seek to feel unique rather than regard luxury as a show of wealth, embracing a unique and differentiated brand of the highest quality and craftsmanship are more important factors than country of origin," she added.
