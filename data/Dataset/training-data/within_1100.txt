"It definitely looks like the industry might be down again this year," said NPD industry analyst Anita Frazier said on Wednesday. LOOKING FOR A TURN AROUND Toy makers entered the holiday season hoping 2006 would mark the year the industry started to turn around. After being hit by years of pricing competition, slipping sales, higher costs and a struggle to evolve as electronics lured away once loyal customers, there were signs business could start to turn around.

But challenges continue to hound the industry. According to NPD, discount stores like Wal-Mart and Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) are grabbing a larger share of toy sales, pressuring toy companies' ability to raise prices. Two new video game consoles also were launched the week before Thanksgiving, taking away dollars that could have been spent on traditional toys.

But Toys "R" Us is looking well beyond traditional toys to boost sales and store traffic. It partnered with Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS for the U.S. launch of its Wii video game console November 19, drawing thousands of shoppers to its stores. "The toy industry is still trying to shake itself out -- figuring out how to deal with Wal-Mart, how to deal with Target," said FAO Schwarz Chief Executive Officer Ed Schmults in an interview on Monday.

"Children are losing interest in toys at younger ages and turning to video games, DVDs, iPods, Web surfing, MySpace and instant messaging for entertainment," ratings agency Standard & Poor's said in a report on Wednesday. The traditional toy industry has suffered sales declines each year since 2002, and video games will be a permanent competitive pressure, S&P said.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS? NPD's latest sales numbers do not include November or the Thanksgiving weekend that kicks off the holiday shopping season. On Monday toy executives were optimistic about how the weekend sales rang up. "Through the weekend, I thought it was much more active than it had been in the last couple of years," said Neil Friedman, president of Mattel Brands, of the activity he saw in stores over the holiday weekend.
