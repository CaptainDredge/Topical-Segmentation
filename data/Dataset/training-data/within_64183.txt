NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 last week, according to a report on Thursday that could stoke fears the labor market recovery has stalled.The U.S. trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly in April, as U.S. exports rose to a new record and imports from Japan tumbled more than 25 percent in the aftermath of its earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, a U.S. government report showed on Thursday.

The current average is an improvement from May's and April's (of 426.8k and 432.3k respectively) but still disappointing given that we saw an average of 393k in March." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS "April's trade deficit of $43.7 bln was sharply below the $48.9 bln consensus, with the breakdown suggesting the surprise was led by a surprisingly steep improvement in the petroleum balance, due to volumes outweighing price changes, and a sharp fall in imports from Japan after the disaster there.

We're going to be in a very active trading range and we just need a couple of key warnings-- on consumer confidence, energy prices, whatever-- and markets could continue to weaken, which will further increase demand for ultra-safe assets." DAVID RESSLER, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK "The trade numbers were a bit of a surprise that suggests a bigger narrowing of the trade deficit than had been expected, probably more than most people had assumed in their Q2 GDP growth forecasts.

But on the more encouraging front it looks like this may be a reflection of job turnover as opposed to sustained joblessness." "We're seeing a decline in the number of continuing benefits, suggesting these layoffs are relatively short-term, not persisting." "I would imagine markets that are looking for some reassurance that we are not going to recession would be pleased to see the trade numbers because they certainly say we are getting some growth from the trade sector." THOMAS SIMONS, MONEY MARKET ECONOMIST, JEFFERIES & CO, NEW YORK "The trade balance is narrower than everybody thought it was going to be, a 3 billion drop in imports from Japan will be a temporary move, right now it looks like its going to be positive for Q2 GDP, but by the end of June the bounce back will be obvious I think.

-----

The improvement, led by sectors experiencing temporary exceptional circumstances, looks unlikely to be sustained for long. However this data should restrain what had previously been growing pessimism on Q2 GDP, and keep forecasts for the quarter comfortably above 2.0 percent." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures add to gains. BONDS: U.S. bond prices pare gains.
