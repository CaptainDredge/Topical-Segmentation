Asian steelmakers would be hard hit by further hikes. Steelmakers in South Korea and Taiwan are waiting for Japanese mills to reach a deal with Australian miners, but can continue to pay last year's prices up to September. Other Asian steelmakers' shares were also lower, with South Korea's Posco ( 005490.KS ), the world's number four steelmaker, down 1.9 percent despite an announcement that it would raise steel prices by 21 percent in July.

We're substantially disadvantaged on price," Randolph said. BHP and Rio typically follow the first settlement reached, but the stakes have been raised this year as the value they can squeeze out of their iron ore assets is seen as a key factor in the $167 billion BHP bid for Rio. But many analysts say it will be difficult for BHP to secure a further price increase from its negotiations with the Chinese steelmakers, as there's already a benchmark price settled.

Miners signaled they wanted to move away from the system. President of Vale, Roger Agnelli, said at an event in Sao Paulo that the breaking of the so-called benchmark precedence system is a positive sign. Kloppers said BHP has stopped signing long-term iron ore contracts on traditional benchmark terms and it was not interested in selling on the spot market, but would renegotiate contracts on market-related terms.

This year is the first time that miners have not all accepted the same percentage change in iron ore prices, opening the door to further differentials by quality and region. That could change the tenor of annual term price negotiations, in which traditionally all mills and miners accept whatever settlement is reached first.

For European steelmakers, analysts say the picture is slightly different as they are more comfortable in passing their costs to their customers. "Tight steel supply fundamentals will allow steelmakers to continue passing on these costs through higher steel prices," said Jeffrey Largey, analyst at JP Morgan. In Europe, major steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal and Corus, owned by Tata Steel have raised their prices several times to far this year.
