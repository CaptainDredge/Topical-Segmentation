"It would be foolish for me to say it doesn't have any effect whatsoever," said Steven Landry, vice president of sales and field operations for Chrysler, in an interview at the New York International Auto Show. "It certainly does, but it's a very unique and hopefully not a frequent situation to have." Landry said that despite an 8 percent dip in March sales, Chrysler still hit its internal monthly sales target last month, and it was working to allay concerns among its dealers.

"There's always a little anxiety from a personal level," said Klegon, in an interview, also at the auto show. "The good news from the product side is that the product plan is intact. There's a lot of future there." He declined to say whether he would prefer Chrysler to be taken over by another automaker, or private equity interests, which sources close to the situation have said are front-runners in the bidding for Chrysler.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top U.S. Chrysler Group executives said on Wednesday the automaker's sales and product lines are on track despite the distractions of a possible sale by German parent DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE.DaimlerChrysler acknowledged for the first time earlier on Wednesday it was talking with prospective buyers of its loss-making Chrysler Group unit, but did not identify the bidders or commit itself to a sale.

"The brands aren't changing, the products aren't changing," said Landry. "Our good dealers understand that we'll be selling Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep for an awfully long time." Frank Klegon, Chrysler's executive vice president of product development, said the situation had not so far affected its development of new cars and trucks.
