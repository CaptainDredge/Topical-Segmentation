"I don't see why Chinese officials can't say something about the U.S. dollar weakness. Everyone else seems to say it around the world," Paulson said, adding that he still considered U.S. economic fundamentals to be strong. But Chinese officials took a more measured tone on the dollar, telling reporters a falling greenback was not in U.S. or anyone else's interest and calling for the United States to be "responsible" in its attitude.

The energy pact will focus on electricity, air, water, transportation and conservation of forests and wetlands ecosystems. Specific plans for the pact were not disclosed, but Paulson said it would build upon an energy and environmental cooperation pact announced last December. Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, standing beside Paulson at a press conference after the latest round of bilateral talks dubbed a "strategic economic dialogue," said the two countries will coordinate monetary and fiscal policies, adding both were committed to the principles of free trade.

U.S. business groups see such an investment treaty as a way to pry open closely guarded Chinese markets for everything from financial services to industrial goods.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese officials agreed on Wednesday to launch negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty and to expand cooperation on energy and environmental issues, but differences remained as to how quickly Beijing should liberalize its markets.At the conclusion of two days of high-level economic talks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said an investment pact "would send a strong signal that our two nations welcome investment and will treat each other's investors in a fair and transparent manner." He said the ten-year energy framework agreement would engage businesses, academics and leading research facilities to share knowledge as well as commercialize new alternative energy and environmental technologies.
