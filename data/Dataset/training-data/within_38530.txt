GM will consider appeals through the weekend, he said. Chrysler Group LLC Deputy Chief Executive Jim Press told the panel Chrysler had sold or redistributed all of the vehicle inventory from the 789 dealers it terminated in bankruptcy. Chrysler had offered no appeals. Some dealers have said Chrysler applied severe pressure earlier in 2009 to buy vehicles even though sales were weak and the automaker's prospects were fast deteriorating.

Italy's Fiat SpA completed a takeover of Chrysler earlier this week. House and Senate members have introduced legislation to force changes in how GM and Chrysler handle the dealership cuts, which dealers estimate will cost 100,000 jobs. The automakers believe many of the dealerships will survive in other forms, such as by selling used cars.

"I am concerned that the accelerated timeframe for dealership closures and the way in which dealers have been treated may actually damage the brands more than help them," Stupak said. GM plans to eliminate 1,280 U.S. dealerships from its network through October 2010, leaving the company with at least 3,500. The wind down of the franchises would take place over the next 17 months and would include some compensation.

Auto executives have said the closing dealerships may have had several issues such as low sales volume, poor customer service, locations too close together or in areas no longer seen as desirable to the automakers. "In 24 hours, I was told that everything my family and I had worked for 84 years would be taken away," Frank Blankenbeckler of Carlisle Chevrolet Co in Waxahachie, Texas, said choking back tears.

Chrysler filed for bankruptcy on April 30. Lawmakers asked Press about a phone call in which he told dealers that Chrysler would have a "long memory" if they did not help the manufacturer. "I would never threaten a dealer," Press said. Chrysler plans a network of about 2,300 U.S. dealerships under its newly constituted company.
