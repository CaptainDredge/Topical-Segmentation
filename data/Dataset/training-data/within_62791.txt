"We will now analyze what was handed to us and later today or tomorrow morning the party will announce its position," he said. European officials want to ensure cross-party agreement by Portugal on the bailout in order to avoid the possibility of having to revisit terms of the deal after the June 5 election.

They are also worried that Finland, where an anti-euro party could form part of the next government, may hinder a deal. "I do not see problems with the PSD accepting the deal, which looks like the only possible option for Portugal right now," said Antonio Costa Pinto, a political analyst in Lisbon.

The source told Reuters taxes will rise on cars and property and there will be cuts in health, education and housing. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, also forecast a two percent contraction this year. "Against this background, while the confirmation of the bailout should provide some reassurance that Portugal will be able meet its upcoming bond redemptions, it won't put an end to speculation that -- along with Greece and perhaps others -- it will sooner or later need to undertake some form of debt restructuring," he said.

SHARP RECESSION LOOMS Analysts say Socrates was eager to present the bailout terms first in an attempt to highlight the fact that it did not impose equally tough measures as those adopted by Greece and Ireland, hoping to gain an electoral advantage. But an official source told Reuters the steps to be included in the deal, such as higher taxes, point to a "contraction of 2 percent in gross domestic product in 2011 and in 2012." That will make it yet more challenging for the heavily indebted country, which has had some of the lowest growth rates in Europe for a decade, to return to financial health.

The bailout deal includes up to 12 billion euros for the banking sector to recapitalize and orders banks to raise their core Tier 1 capital ratios gradually to 10 percent by the end of 2012, the official source said. It also envisages 5.3 billion euros in privatization revenues until 2013. The interest rate on Portugal's bailout loan is expected to be set at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in mid-May.
