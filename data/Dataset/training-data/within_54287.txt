It fell to less than $1.40 earlier this week on expectations the shut pipeline might help drain high inventories. Canada's Enbridge ( ENB.TO ), hit by three oil pipeline outages since July, said repairs on its U.S.-bound Line 6A crude pipeline were completed on Tuesday but that it would be up to the U.S. Department of Transportation whether 6A could be restarted by the end of the week.

The spread jumped on Wednesday to a high of $13.99 a barrel, the highest level since the spread rose to $14.21 on May 20. "A stout European gas oil trade is still providing support (to heating oil crack spreads) as has some relatively favorable demand indications out of the past couple of EIA weekly releases," Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a research note.

The Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said Wednesday it had not set a date to resume flows along Line 6A and that the restart of any pipeline required a "comprehensive review." "The market driver today is the expectation that Enbridge (pipeline) will come back online sooner rather than later," Olivier Jakob, consultant with Petromatrix, said.

Gasoline stocks fell 694,000 barrels, in line with expectations. The Enbridge pipeline shutting last Thursday was expected to help reduce stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub, delivery point for U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate. Cushing stocks did slip 581,000 barrels last week, the EIA said. Along with some recent unseasonal dips in U.S. distillate stocks, refinery maintenance and strong diesel cargo prices in Europe have helped push the U.S. heating oil crack spread -- the profit that refiners make in processing crude into fuel -- to surge to its highest level in nearly four months.

Most financial markets were roiled by Japan's intervening to weaken its currency for the first time in six years. The dollar rose more than 3 percent against the yen, but analysts said it was uncertain the intervention would depress the currency for long. But the dollar seesawed and was little changed against the euro, the currency pairing most oil traders focus on.
