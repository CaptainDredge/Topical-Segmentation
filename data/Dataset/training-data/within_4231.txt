Express Scripts could not be immediately reached for comment. CVS said the merger would solidly add to earnings and cash flow in 2008 and the combined company was expected to retain a "solid investment grade rating." Shares of CVS gained $1.09, or 3.5 percent, to close on the Big Board at $32.41.

CVS, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain, said its shareholders would vote on the deal on March 15. Caremark's shareholders are scheduled to vote on March 16. Although Express Scripts has offered more money, a deal with Caremark would not close until the third quarter of 2007. Its offer for Caremark still faces regulatory review and shareholder approval.

CVS also said the merged CVS-Caremark would launch a cash tender offer for 150 million shares, or about 10 percent of its outstanding stock, at $35 a share. The changes CVS made to its bid "make an already compelling transaction even more attractive for Caremark shareholders," Caremark said. "The near-term cash value has been increased by $3.2 billion since the merger was originally announced, while the $5.25 billion post-closing tender offer will increase the earnings accretion of this powerful combination," Caremark said.

PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) sweetened its $23.9 billion takeover bid for Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N on Thursday with an increased dividend, calling its newest proposal its "best and final" offer for the pharmacy-benefits manager.CVS, seeking to thwart rival suitor Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), offered to pay $54.12 a share, plus a higher, one-time dividend of $7.50 per share after closing of the deal.

Caremark reaffirmed its support for the CVS transaction and rebuffed the revised offer made by Express Scripts on Wednesday. Express Scripts' hostile bid still failed to "address the deficiencies in the original Express Scripts proposal, particularly its highly conditional and highly leveraged nature, nor does it address the significant risks of business disruption and customer attrition," Caremark said.
