Cigna reported adjusted income of $2.67 per share from operations. Analysts on average expected $2.51, according to Reuters Estimates. The report is the last among large U.S. health insurers for the first quarter. The companies have generally reported higher or better-than-expected profits, but some of them worried investors because of a higher rate of medical costs eating into premium dollars.

Cigna had only 98.8 million shares outstanding on average during the quarter, compared with 122.5 million a year earlier. The company forecast adjusted earnings per share of $10.25 to $10.95 for 2007. Analysts were expecting $10.65. For the second quarter, the company said it expected profit of $2.45 to $2.70 per share.

Membership in Cigna's health plans rose by about 812,000 members, or 9 percent, to 9.83 million at the end of March from a year earlier and by 441,000 members from the end of 2006. The company forecast membership growth of 5 percent to 6.5 percent for 2007. Cigna's guaranteed cost loss ratio -- which measures medical costs as a percentage of premium dollars -- improved to 84.4 percent from 86.5 percent a year earlier.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cigna Corp. ( CI.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly net income fell 18 percent from a year earlier, when it recorded large investment gains, but results beat estimates as membership in its health insurance plans jumped.Net income fell to $289 million, or $2.93 per share, from $352 million, or $2.87 per share, a year earlier, when the company had more shares outstanding.

One such gauge, involving health plans for which Cigna takes on full risk, came in better than McDonald projected, while another, which also includes plans that base premiums on the company's previous claim experience, came in worse than he expected. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $4.4 billion. Health-care premiums and fees rose about 14 percent to $2.7 billion, reflecting membership growth and rate increases.
