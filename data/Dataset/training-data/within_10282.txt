"Now, that volatility has gone down to around 15 percent, the risks have been adjusted and it appears that the deal will go through as financing is brought forward." That KKR is adding a covenant shows just how nervous investment banks are now that the credit crunch has frozen much of the leveraged buyout industry.

The expectation was that after last week's Labor Day holiday, some investors would return, and the banks could begin trying to unload the debt. The sale of the First Data debt financing was expected to start by mid-week, the Journal said. Reuters reported last week that the banks were marketing smaller portions of the debt from the deal to see what kind of price they could get.

Private equity buyers have provided a gravy train of fees to Wall Street through advising and arranging the deals. LBO firms have paid more than $11 billion in fees this year alone. LBO financing was so lucrative for the banks that they offered cheap and easy loans to buyers without any covenants, which up until the last few years were standard.

Adding a covenant makes it easier for the investment banks to sell the debt to investors worried about the deal's risks. Although it is a fairly standard agreement, such a move would be a major concession for KKR, which previously had been unwilling to budge on financing terms. Adding a covenant puts greater pressure on KKR to meet the EBITDA standard and could mean lowering the returns expected from the deal.

The banks on the First Data deal have claimed they would face losses of as much as $1.5 billion if the terms were not altered, the Journal said. Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) are the leaders in arranging First Data's $16 billion loan. Other banks on the deal include Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Lehman Brothers LEH.N, Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Merrill Lynch  MER.N. A KKR concession also shows how strained relations between Wall Street banks and large buyout firms have become.
