BJ's stock rose 4.1 percent or 63 cents to $16.06 on Monday, while Baker Hughes shares fell 9.6 percent to $34.45. Their combined market capitalization will be around that of National Oilwell Varco Inc ( NOV.N ), but still well behind Schlumberger, worth $68 billion, and Halliburton, at $21 billion. Under the terms of the deal, if either company pulls out, it must pay the other $175 million.

Baker Hughes expects annual cost savings of about $75 million in 2010 and $150 million in 2011.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc ( BHI.N ) said on Monday it would buy smaller peer BJ Services Co BJS.N for $4.8 billion to create a one-stop shopping destination for its oil and gas producing customers and better take on the industry's leaders.With the deal, Baker Hughes, the No. 4 oilfield services company by market value, will be better able to compete with Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) and Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) for projects that require multiple services as it bets on a recovery in the North American natural gas market.

The proposed deal comes after natural gas prices slid to a seven-year low last week. "The business logic is one where both companies felt that all the major international oil and gas players want to rely increasingly on a one-stop approach where they can bundle services," said John Olson, a fund manager at Houston Energy Partners.

Shares of smaller oilfield services firms surged after the news in anticipation of more potential deals. "This has long been eyed by Baker to establish a more competitive position against the other two players," Capital One Southcoast analyst Pierre Connor said. "It's not a huge premium, but I think the market has been holding up BJ's price in anticipation of something like this." BJ stockholders will receive 0.40035 share of Baker Hughes and $2.69 in cash for each of their shares, which totaled $17.94 a share based on Friday's closing price.
