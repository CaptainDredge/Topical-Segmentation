It's just more of the same." The auction-rate securities market "is dead." BRIAN YELVINGTON, ANALYST, CREDITSIGHTS, NEW YORK "It's really a face-saving attempt." "The people who bought auction-rate securities are primarily retail clients, but what we're seeing is face saving. If Citi is able to pull this off, the other banks that have sponsored these programs could be under pressure to do something similar." "It puts pressure on the other players like UBS, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, to do the same thing." The buying back of securities "looks like it is bigger than we would have thought - $7 billion versus an expected $5 billion to $6 billion." "It is an individual investor move.

"The problem is they've got to take all these billions of dollars on the balance sheet again.

They have to buy the stuff back and either take some loss on them or restructure them." "It does make it more expensive to borrow on the front end. It's going to be hard to revive this market. Issuers are being forced out the curve with their borrowing. That puts more supply on the back end than the front end." TIM MCGREGOR, DIRECTOR, MUNICIPAL FIXED INCOME, NORTHERN  TRUST, CHICAGO: "I guess probably this is the start of the solution to the problem," as other banks likely will follow suit.
