Following are analysts' comments on the reshuffle: STEFANOS MANOS, FORMER FINANCE MINISTER "This buys Papandreou just a little time. By putting (outspoken backbencher Pantelis) Oikonomou and Venizelos in government, he makes sure that the mid-term budget plan will pass. But this just delays his problems for 15 days." "Oikonomou, in particular, belongs to the populist wing of PASOK.

The prime minister is only using party officials. It is a reshuffle that smoothes out imbalances in the party." "What is important is that the new scheme is smaller and more efficient, and for the first time we have a body -- a government committee -- which is positive as a lack of coordination was obvious in the former government." "However, with this reshuffle he mainly just recycled faces." "I also believe that there was a political agreement between the two -- Papandreou and Venizelos -- and the question is whether in this framework the economic policies will change, probably toward a more popular direction." BEN MAY, EMEA ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS "From an IMF/EU perspective what matters is that they stay on the right path, not who says it.

Oikonomou and Venizelos are both less willing and able than Papaconstantinou to reduce the size of the state, which should be the main priority, in my view." "Those who are called to implement the midterm budget plan believe in it less than Papaconstantinou." YANNIS VAROUFAKIS, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS "The reshuffle of the Greek government is going to be treated by history with the contempt it deserves." "Given the fact that for 24 hours we've been told (former European Central Bank Vice President Lucas) Papademos was Papandreou's last resort, the announcement that Venizelos is getting the job discredits the finance minister before he even moves into the finance ministry." "The whole government is breathing its last breath.

I wouldn't have thought it (who holds the finance minister post) would make a huge difference either way." ALEXANDER KYRTSIS, ANALYST, UBS "Venizelos is politically powerful and that might bode well for the implementation of fiscal consolidation, even though he has no track record in financial matters. His appointment means that the government will likely get the vote of confidence." "The PM had to replace Papaconstantinou to appease his party." (Reporting by Athens bureau)

ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou appointed Evangelos Venizelos as finance minister in a reshuffle on Friday, replacing George Papaconstantinou, the author of a painful IMF- and EU-mandated reform program.Greek stocks climbed as some analysts said it could help ensure passage of a fiscal consolidation plan, but the cost of insuring Greek debt against default hit a fresh record high above 2,000 basis points on Friday.
