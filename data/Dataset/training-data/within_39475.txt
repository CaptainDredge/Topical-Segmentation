WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from the U.S. House Financial Services and House Agriculture committees' joint hearing on Friday on the Obama administration's proposal to regulate over-the-counter derivatives with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.GEITHNER ON CONTROLLING OIL PRICE VOLATILITY: "I think what the CFTC chairman proposed the other day ...

I think it is worth trying to see whether you can limit that risk through better disclosure -- hard to do, a lot of people have tried it. If you're going to do that effectively you're going to have to do that in a common approach to where oil and other commodities are traded globally." GEITHNER ON EFFECTIVENESS OF STIMULUS: "The stimulus package is on its expected path in terms of the rate of putting money in the pockets of taxpayers, to provide substantial forms of assistance to states to reduce the risk of their being forced to fire tens of thousands of teachers, workers, firemen, and there are very substantial investments in infrastructure projects that have already started to take effect and will have their maximum impact on he economy in the second half of the year.

My own sense is, and I think this is the consensus of broad-based economists, that there have been substantial improvements in arresting what was the worst recession globally we've seen in generations." GEITHNER ON DEFINING STANDARDIZED CONTRACTS: "I don't think we have made a financial judgment as to what extent we want to define those attributes of standardized contracts in statute or in regulation.

The most conspicuous and most damaging examples of this were the monoline insurance companies and AIG. These firms and others sold huge amounts of credit protection on mortgage-backed securities and other more complex real-estate related securities without the capacity to meet their obligations in an economic downturn." GEITHNER ON OBJECTIVES TO REGULATE MARKET: "In designing its proposed reforms for the OTC derivative markets, the Administration has attempted to achieve four broad objectives: * Preventing activities in the OTC derivative markets from posing risk to the stability of the financial system; * Promoting efficiency and transparency of the OTC derivative markets; * Preventing market manipulation, fraud, and other abuses; and * Protecting consumers and investors by ensuring that OTC derivatives are not marketed inappropriately to unsophisticated parties."

But this is why we have to act and why we need to deliver very substantial change." GEITHNER ON DANGER OF CURRENT REGULATION OF OTC DERIVATIVES: "Under our existing regulatory system, some types of financial institutions were allowed to sell large amounts of protection against certain risks without adequate capital to back those commitments.
