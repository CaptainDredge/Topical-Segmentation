The department will release its employment situation report on Friday. "One of the biggest factors is going to be the seasonal factor. We saw virtually no hiring in the retail sector last year. Seasonal factors will give a much more favorable weighting to the employment numbers (in November)," said Lindsey Piegza, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.

The U.S. economy started growing again in the third quarter after four successive quarters of contraction. "The labor market remains the single biggest threat to the emerging recovery," said Meny Grauman, an economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto. "Payrolls could begin rising again in January, but the pace of improvement may be slowed down by the fact that even those Americans who have managed to hold on to their jobs during this downturn have, on average, seen their hours cut substantially." Data ranging from regional manufacturing surveys to weekly new applications for state unemployment benefits have generally painted a picture of a labor market that is starting to settle down after an upheaval early this year.

GOVERNMENT DRIVING GROWTH A drop in the pace of job losses this month will be seen as more proof that the economy's recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s was gathering momentum. It will also help to ease fears over the durability of a recovery that is seen as being largely driven by government spending.

The Reuters survey forecast the average workweek rising to 33.1 hours in November from 30 hours the previous month. "The rebound in business profits suggests the labor market deterioration is in its final stages, barring a relapse in financial conditions," said Joseph Brusuelas, an economist at Moody's Economy.com in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Seasonal factors were based on 10 years of data, but last year had the biggest weight, she said, adding that outsized increases or declines tended to cause the seasonals to shift in the opposite direction a year later. "Payrolls fell 597,000 in November 2008, marking the first of the six biggest payroll declines in the recession, so we're looking for a positive shift this year which should be worth 50,000-75,000 jobs," Piegza said.
