WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Following are highlights from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's prepared speech to be delivered at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.BERNANKE ON CURRENT STATE OF ECONOMY "After contracting sharply over the past year, economic activity appears to be leveling out, both in the United States and abroad, and the prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good.

"Among other objectives, liquidity guidelines must take into account the risks that inadequate liquidity planning by major financial firms pose for the broader financial system, and they must ensure that these firms do not become excessively reliant on liquidity support from the central bank." ON CURRENT STATE OF MARKETS "Overall, the policy actions implemented in recent months have helped stabilize a number of key financial markets, both in the United States and abroad.

Short-term funding markets are functioning more normally, corporate bond issuance has been strong, and activity in some previously moribund securitization markets has picked up. Stock prices have partially recovered, and U.S. mortgage rates have declined markedly since last fall. Critically, fears of financial collapse have receded substantially." ON FAILURE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS "Concerted government attempts to find a buyer for the company or to develop an industry solution proved unavailing, and the company's available collateral fell well short of the amount needed to secure a Federal Reserve loan of sufficient size to meet its funding needs.

... The economic recovery is likely to be relatively slow at first, with unemployment declining only gradually from high levels." ON REGULATORY REFORM "We must urgently address structural weaknesses in the financial system, in particular in the regulatory framework, to ensure that the enormous costs of the past two years will not be borne again." ON LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT "In particular, the experience has underscored that liquidity risk management is as essential as capital adequacy and credit and market risk management, particularly during times of intense financial stress.
