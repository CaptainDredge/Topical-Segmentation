RIM's profit rose to $518.3 million, or 90 cents a share, in its fourth quarter ended February 28, from $412.5 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier. The results topped the expectations of analysts, which had been dampened by a profit warning that RIM delivered in February. "They are crushing it," Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek said.

Still, the company is keeping a close eye on operating expenses to make sure it can continue to thrive even if the downturn continues, RIM co-CEO Jim Balsillie said during a conference call with analysts. "RIM is faring well in the current environment and we continue to believe we can grow market share," he said.

Meanwhile, large corporations that use the BlackBerry as the mobile communications tool of choice have also cut their budgets. Even so, Balsillie said, demand from corporate customers is also staying strong. RIM's main customers have traditionally been business executives, lawyers, politicians and other professionals who use its BlackBerry handsets to send wireless email securely.

It expects to add between 3.7 million and 3.9 million subscribers. It added 3.9 million this quarter. Analysts had previously expressed concern about RIM's ability to maintain momentum during the recession. But such worries -- as well as the February profit warning -- seemed like ancient history on Thursday as RIM's shares jumped to $59.52 in late trading from their regular-session close of $49.09 on the Nasdaq.

To diversify its user base, RIM has pushed aggressively into the broader consumer market with multimedia-laden handsets like the Pearl model and the touchscreen BlackBerry Storm -- its answer to Apple's ( AAPL.O ) popular iPhone. This week, it also launched an online store to sell entertainment, games, news and travel software to BlackBerry users.
