"That was one of the bases upon which we got George Washington University Hospital. They wanted a rebuild and went into partnership with us," Miller said. Universal Health opened a replacement building for the hospital in 2003. The company nearly doubled in size with its 2010 purchase of Psychiatric Solutions Inc, the largest standalone operator of psychiatric inpatient facilities, for $3.1 billion.

Such deep pockets have let Community Health, Universal Health and others snap up an aging hospital and then replace it with a modern facility built from the ground up. Community Health has bought 15 hospitals in the last three years. In April, it unveiled the newly constructed Siloam Springs Regional Hospital in Arkansas.

Their actions are drawing new interest from some investors, who are lured by the companies' historically low stock valuations and the expectation that their expanding clout and focus on efficiency will help solve a growing national healthcare crisis. They are betting against a wider market sentiment that hospitals will be pressured to rein in costs and see revenue suffer as Americans skimp on medical treatment in a weak economy.

Earlier this month, Universal Health announced a deal to acquire Ascend Health Corp, a chain of nine psychiatric inpatient facilities, for $517 million. Another strategy for hospital operators is to expand treatment offered in lower-cost outpatient clinics. HCA and Tenet, which operate largely in urban settings, are two examples. "Outpatient clinics have much lower overhead, and in general, you have much higher commercial patient visits if you go into the higher-wealth suburbs or specific markets," Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said.

Community Health is trading at just 6.6 times estimated 2012 earnings, compared with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.6 for the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. HMA trades at 7.5 times forward earnings, while HCA trades at 7.2, Tenet at 8.3, Universal Health Services Inc at 9.1 and LifePoint at 11.7, according to Thomson Reuters data.
