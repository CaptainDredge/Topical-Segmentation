JP Morgan and other lenders gain lucrative fees from funding these mergers, bankers noted. The diversity of InBev's funding pool shows the presence of Santander and other regional banks, illustrating how banks in emerging markets and continental Europe have available funds due to lower exposure to financial turmoil in the U.S., investment bankers said.

Meanwhile, Mars recently agreed to buy Wm Wrigley Jr Co WWY.N with the help of $17.2 billion in funding from JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), as well as about $6.5 billion in help from billionaire Warren Buffett. "These are recession-resistant businesses with steady cash flow and bankable names," said one arbitrageur who declined to be named.

"InBev is an easy company to finance; it's massively strong and has cash flow everywhere," a second source familiar with the InBev offer said. InBev said it had funding from Banco Santander SA ( SAN.MC ), Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ), BNP Paribas SA ( BNPP.PA ), Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ), Fortis NV FOR.BR, JP Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ).

"Banks will support large debt amounts. No one's going to take a loss on InBev; these are not names that are going to default," the third source said. In addition to backing InBev's offer for Anheuser-Busch, JP Morgan also backed Mars's planned takeover of Wrigley. JP Morgan has weathered the damage caused by the U.S. subprime crisis better than many of its rivals and absorbed rival Bear Stearns.

The stock had been hurt in recent weeks amid investors' concerns that InBev would have to raise as much as $17 billion in a rights issue to help finance the deal, which would have diluted the stock. STRONG NAMES GAIN SUPPORT InBev and Mars are not alone in securing mega-billion funding packages.
