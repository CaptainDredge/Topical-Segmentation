"What happens otherwise?" he asked rhetorically. "What is happening now? Four big countries of the Union gather together. A group of big member states want to discuss the financial situation with possible consequences for the entire Union." Verhofstadt said the problem of inflation in the euro zone, which was stable in December at a six-and-a-half year high of 3.1 percent, "proves more than ever that the euro zone and the European Union need socio-economic governance".
