Lawmakers want to avoid a repeat of the $700 billion bailout fund that was used to help major financial firms, including AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as well as automakers. Regulators on Friday charged Goldman Sachs with fraud linked to subprime mortgages sparking fears in the broader market of civil lawsuits that could make it more difficult for the financial industry to fight tough reforms.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Sunday expressed confidence that lawmakers will bridge partisan differences on the overhaul of financial regulations and pass a bill that protects taxpayers from financing future bailouts."I am very confident that we're going to have the votes for a strong package of financial reforms that will bring derivative markets out of the dark, help protect the taxpayers from having to fund future bailouts and trying to make sure we're getting Americans some basic protection against fraud and abuse," Geithner told NBC's "Meet the Press." Republicans have attacked a bill that was passed by the Senate Banking Committee without their support, saying it would expand the government's reach too far into private markets and allow for endless taxpayer bailouts of big banks.

Obama said on Friday he would veto any bill that did not impose strong enough controls over markets for derivatives. Meanwhile, Bill Clinton said in an interview with ABC's "This Week" that he made a mistake not pushing for more derivatives regulation while he was president. "The argument on derivatives was that these things are expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of investors will buy them, and they don't need any extra protection and any extra transparency," Clinton said.

The House of Representatives has passed its version of the legislation. With control of the Senate and House of Representatives at stake in the November election, Democrats and Republicans are tapping into the anger felt by many Americans against Wall Street firms in the wake of the financial crisis. Reining in Wall Street is seen as a popular move with voters.

"The banks are going to be on the hook for paying the cost of any future crisis," Geithner said. "That's something you're going to see Democrats and Republicans agree on 'cause it's a basic thing of fairness." Geithner said lawmakers were close to reaching bipartisan agreement saying that both Republicans and Democrats agree on the need to end to the concept of "too big to fail." But the two sides are still "some ways apart" on consumer protections and how to regulate derivatives financial instruments that derive their value from the price of some underlying instrument or event, Geithner said.
