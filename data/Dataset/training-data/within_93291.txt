It is based on how consumers perceive each brand in seven categories: quality, safety, value, performance, design, technology and green attributes. The first two categories remain the top buying factors, the magazine said. Toyota led with a score of 133 points, up about 11 points from last year. Ford, Honda and Chevy saw their total perception scores respectively rise about 2 points to 117.8 points, about 26 points to 114 and more than 7 points to 94.4. Rounding out the top 10 after Mercedes (77.4 points) and Volvo (76.5 points) were GM's Cadillac (66.2 points), BMW ( BMWG.DE ) (65.6 points), Chrysler's ( FIA.MI ) Dodge brand (55.8 points) and Tesla ( TSLA.O ) (54.8 points).

The survey comes less than a month after the Detroit auto show, during which the industry showed off its latest vehicles and concept cars. Bartlett said the survey was "one window into what consumers are thinking" and is often a lagging indicator influenced by news headlines or neighborhood experiences. Each of the top 10 saw perception scores rise in the survey.

"The brand leaders have a really strong hold on the mind-share of the consumer," Jeff Bartlett, deputy auto editor online for Consumer Reports, said in an interview. "We're seeing much less space between brands. In other words, consumers seem to think many excel in the areas that matter most to them and it's harder for brands to stand out." For example, he said safety is very important to consumers, but most cars are pretty safe.
