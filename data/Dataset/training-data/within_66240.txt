Deutsche Bank shares were down 0.4 percent at 38.06 euros at 1120 GMT (7:20 a.m. EDT), slightly outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index .SX7P, which was 0.6 percent lower. ACKERMANN'S SHADOW Deutsche Bank's earnings figures came hours after it named investment banking head Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen, head of its business in Germany, as co-chief executives from 2012.

The desire to crimp Jain's influence at the 141-year-old lender reflects widespread suspicion of investment banking, and offers a glimpse into tensions that have dogged Deutsche Bank for the best part of 20 years. Jain -- who is in charge of some of the world's most risk-hungry traders -- has struggled to build a network in Germany, since this was traditionally the stomping ground of either Fitschen or Ackermann.

But some industry observers said Deutsche Bank's decision to keep Ackermann on as chairman, also announced late on Monday, would put a leash on Jain. "We are concerned that Ackermann moving from CEO to Chairman would maintain the status quo in strategy - meaning business as usual on an operational basis with Anshu Jain constrained in making his mark on the group," analysts at J.P. Morgan said.

It also said Ackermann would replace supervisory board chairman Clemens Boersig, putting him in a position to influence the bank's strategy and appointments to its board. Fears that Deutsche Bank could neglect its German roots and expand risk-taking activities prompted key members of the supervisory board to opt for the dual CEO model, adding Fitschen's contact book in Germany to Jain's ability to deliver profits.

That leaves the global investment banking heavyweight more dependent on retail banking and wealth and asset management to meet the full-year targets set by outgoing Chief Executive Josef Ackermann, and analysts remain sceptical. "Nobody really believed that Deutsche would reach its 10 billion euros goal," Philipp Haessler, an analyst at Frankfurt-based Equinet, said.
