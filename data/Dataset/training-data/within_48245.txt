"With bigger buying plans, it's still very mixed. We are stabilizing at very low levels. You still have this uncertainty in the consumer sector." JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK "This will help the market and add credence to the economic recovery school of thought. Its logical that with the economy improving and stocks going up consumer confidence would improve.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in March, helped by a slight increase in optimism about the labor market, according to a private report released on Tuesday.COMMENTS: SEAN SIMKO, FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "The confidence number rebounded. The whisper number was a little bit higher, so prior to the release Treasuries had a reason to sell off.

Admittedly it's still not quite as high as it was in January. "We also saw, importantly, better numbers not only on what consumers saw were present conditions, which had a sharp rise, but also looking out into the future. "That is consistent with an improvement in the job market. obviously all eyes are on the release expected at 8:30 a.m. on Good Friday here and would suggest that the whisper numbers indicating that perhaps as many as 200,000 jobs were created last month may actually come to fruition." STEPHEN CARL, PRINCIPAL AND HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY TRADING, THE WILLIAMS CAPITAL GROUP LP, NEW YORK: "It looked pretty good...it's a nice number in relation to the prior period and a little bitter than the survey, and it's going to lend to a more positive day (for stocks) I think, given the lighter volume." CARY LEAHEY, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "You got more than an expected bounce in the series, but that having been said you are still four points below where you were in January when you had that February stock market and weather-related plunge.

"All in all, it's a positive number that is moving in the right direction, but the data will be choppy. It will take some time to regain full confidence." DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY: "We're seeing a nice rebound here and that was pretty welcome news because things were so negative in February.

But that said, confidence particularly on this measure relative to the Reuters/UMich survey remains very depressed. "Consumers feel a lot worse than would be implied by the improvement in the labor market or the actual level of spending. Those two series would suggest that this index ought to be 30 points higher than where it is.
