In a statement, the State Department said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had decided to use a provision of the Iran Sanctions Act to spare the company from an investigation into its past investments in Iran's energy sector. "This decision is a result of INPEX's October 15 announcement to complete its withdrawal from the $2 billion project in Iran's South Azadegan oil field," the department said, saying Inpex had promised not to conduct any energy-related activity in Iran that could trigger Iran Sanctions Act sanctions.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it will not investigate Inpex Corp ( 1605.T ), Japan's top oil explorer, for its past investments in Iran because of its decision to pull out of an Iranian oilfield project.Inpex on October 15 announced that it would withdraw from Iran's Azadegan oil field project because new U.S. sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program posed a potential threat to the company's business.

"As long as the company continues to act in accordance with its assurances, the secretary does not regard INPEX as a company of concern for its past Iran-related activities," it added. Under the U.S. Iran Sanctions Act, which was expanded this year, a company that violates U.S. limits on investment in Iran's energy sector can suffer up to nine possible sanctions.

The company, which had a 10 percent stake in the oil field, feared the sanctions could hamper its ability to raise money from U.S. institutions as well as hinder its global projects. The United States widened its bilateral sanctions on Iran this year and secured broader U.N. Security Council sanctions to pressure Tehran over its nuclear program, which Washington suspects is designed to build bombs but which Tehran says is to generate electricity.

These include the denial of U.S. Export-Import Bank loans, of licenses for the U.S. export of military technology and of U.S. bank loans exceeding $10 million in one year. Financial institutions can be barred from serving as a primary dealer in U.S. government bonds or as a repository for U.S. government funds.
