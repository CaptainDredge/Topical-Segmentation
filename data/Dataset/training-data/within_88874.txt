WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Weapons makers reported surprisingly strong profit margins this week, even as budget cuts are starting to weigh on revenues. That has prompted a big question: how long can the defense industry sustain good margins?The sector is clearly facing leaner times, with $487 billion in spending reductions slated for the next decade and another $500 billion in cuts due to kick in next year under the process known as sequestration.

But it may take time until margins in longer-cycle businesses like shipbuilding and other metal-bending manufacturing operations come under significant pressure. "You're seeing it in isolated areas already ... but it could take a while for the downward pressures to finally be seen on an aggregate basis," said Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets, adding that point might be reached in another year or so.

General Dynamics Chief Executive Jay Johnson told analysts it was "a blinding flash of the obvious" that his company was seeing the most impact on margins in its information systems sector, where services account for about half of revenues. "There's a margin reality that's attached to that," Johnson said. He said that sector has just won some significant contract awards that would help improve margins, but program managers are insisting on more competition, scaling back contracts, and awarding contracts by assessing the "lowest price, technically acceptable" bid, rather than "best value." Defense consultant Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute said the companies had been preparing for the downturn for years, taking aggressive cost-cutting measures like closing plants and laying off workers to preserve profits, while maintaining solid dividends and buying back shares.

Eventually, Thompson said, cost-cutting efforts will reach a limit since it will get harder and harder for companies to find efficiencies on a dwindling number of programs. "There's a fine line between cutting unnecessary costs and beginning to undermine future business prospects," he said, noting that scaling back research and development spending or marketing would eventually eat into a company's ability to respond to rapidly changing military requirements.

Another plus: Most big defense companies are aggressively pursuing international orders, which generally have higher profit margins, said Jason Gursky, an analyst at Citi Research. Many companies also have weapons programs that are transitioning from development to production, which generally results in more predictable outlays and better returns, he said. "It's not that they're outperforming per se, but they're moving into higher-margin activities and that trend is likely to continue for a while," Gursky said.
