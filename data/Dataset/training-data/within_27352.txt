The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top leading shares fell 2.6 percent, while Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE both shed more than 2 percent. MSCI's main world stock index was down more than 1 percent, as the two-day rebound from a five-year low fizzled. "After the colossal gains achieved at the start of this week, it would seem that the hangover has kicked in and investors have sobered to the reality that recession is here," said Andrew Turnbull, senior sales manager at ODL Securities.

The recessionary fear was also reflected in MSCI's measure of Asian stock markets excluding Japan, which slid 3.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei, however, rose 1.1 percent after spending most of the session in negative territory. U.S. stock futures pointed to a weaker Wall Street open, but pared losses after JP Morgan reported Q3 net income equating to $0.11 per share and reported net markdowns of $3.6 billion.

REAL ECONOMY BITES Governments around the world have announced plans to rescue their banking sectors and kick-start interbank lending, with the United States on Tuesday saying it would inject $250 billion into its banks, including the nation's top nine lenders. But analysts say now the fears of an imminent financial meltdown have given way to economic worries, taking risk-averse investors back to the yen, which saw a stunning rise last week as panic descended ahead of the bailouts and coordinated central bank rate cuts.

LONDON  (Reuters) - Risk aversion wrestled stock markets down on Wednesday, snuffing out a two-day rally as investors returned to last week's rattled state even after government bank bailouts took the edge off money market stress.The yen and gold prices rose, while government bonds also climbed in a fresh bid to unload risk on the reality of recession despite trillions of dollars pledged to recapitalize banks and stem the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.

"Governments have done as much as they can to deal with the banking crisis. The fires have been put out for now, so panic buying in the yen that we saw last week has subsided," said Kikuko Takeda, senior currency economist at BTM UFJ. "But with European shares falling today, it's not surprising that yen support is continuing," she said, adding that more bad news about the banking sector would be seen as a cue to buy more yen.
