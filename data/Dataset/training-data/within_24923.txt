Limited liquidity, or funds, in the system may limit big purchases, however, he said. The $3 trillion market is the source of funds for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investments, the more controversial side of their business since the companies have taken greater risks with purchases in recent years. Fears of a pullback in demand for MBS by the capital constrained companies has been a key factor in the weakness in the market, along with signs that crucial support of foreign central banks was waning.

The reason for the bailout "is a problem that started 15 years ago, when they started expanding their portfolios beyond their mandate of insuring and purchasing conforming loans," Allegiant's Harding said. "They became a very large hedge fund." Treasury support of more than agency debt and guarantee obligations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may lead investors to push U.S. borrowing costs higher, however.

"What you will see is a tremendous rally in MBS and in agency bonds, which in turn will help other credit related" debt," said Andrew Harding, director of taxable fixed-income investing at Allegiant Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio. For the $4.5 trillion mortgage backed securities (MBS) market, where Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the government have guaranteed bonds backed by home loans, the support from Treasury comes after a prolonged slump in prices.

The government, seeking to thwart a loss of confidence in the two companies which are the key to the U.S. housing market, has officially switched its support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from implicit to explicit. The move should boost the prices of debt issued or guaranteed by the companies which has been a staple of bond portfolios from hedge funds to pension funds, insurance companies and conservative mutual funds.

But the Treasury now expects to purchase $5 billion of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds within the next month. "Mortgage rates should drop on this," said Brian Gardner, senior political analyst, at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. "This will add liquidity to the companies and rates should decline." Agency bonds, which are used to fund the investments of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should also get a boost relative to Treasuries given the new government backing, said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.
