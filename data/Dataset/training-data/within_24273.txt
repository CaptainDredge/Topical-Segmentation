EA said that as a result of the weekend talks, it will let its tender offer for all outstanding shares of Take-Two to expire on Monday evening. EA previously extended the offer five times, in part to allow regulators time to review the deal for antitrust concerns, and after a lukewarm response from Take-Two shareholders.

They said a deal could be completed soon after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission completes its antitrust review of the proposed transaction, expected on Thursday. "A mutual deal is going to have to be higher than $25.74, in order for the board of Take-Two to save face -- call it a dollar or two dollars more," said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.

EA wants GTA and other games like "BioShock" and "Civilization" to boost its own line-up and meet the threat posed by rival Activision Blizzard Inc, maker of the hit "Guitar Hero" series. Both EA and Take-Two showed signs of posturing on Monday, analysts said, citing a tacit threat by EA to cut its offering price or walk away, and Take-Two's insistence that it "remains unwavering" in its belief that $25.74 a share is "inadequate." Take-Two added that it is also in talk with other parties, and several analysts suggested the company was angling to squeeze more from EA.

"I think Take-Two ... is going to negotiate a dollar (per share) higher and then claim victory. A deal is going to get done." EA, publisher of the popular "Madden," "Need for Speed" and "Rock Band" games, had in April offered $25.74 per share for Take-Two, which rejected the price as too low.

EA said on Monday its chief executive, John Riccitiello, and Take-Two Executive Chairman Strauss Zelnick held talks over the weekend, and Take-Two's management has agreed to present its three-year product pipeline and financial forecasts to EA. "I think EA called Take-Two and said 'you can either participate or not,'" said Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter.
