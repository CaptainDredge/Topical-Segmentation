The International Monetary Fund too had harsh words for Japan, saying it needed to act urgently to cut its deficit. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has made tax and social security reform, including a future rise in the 5 percent sales tax, a priority given the rising costs of Japan's fast-aging society and a public debt that is the biggest among advanced nations.

"I have been fully aware of the importance of public finances and government bonds since I served as finance minister when the Greek debt crisis hit," Kan told parliament. The Japanese government bond (JGB) market took the S&P move in its stride, reflecting the fact that domestic investors hold about 95 percent of the country's debt, in sharp contrast to troubled smaller European economies, much of whose debt is held by foreign investors.

TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's prime minister vowed on Friday to push ahead with tax reforms to curb bulging public debt, but an uncooperative opposition and divisions within his own party on policy make the chances of success slim.Rating agency Standard and Poor's cut Japan's long-term debt rating on Thursday for the first time since 2002.

Opposition parties can block bills in the upper house, although the budget itself can be enacted after approval by the lower house, where the DPJ has a majority. Some pundits have said Kan could be forced to resign or even call a snap election if the budget-related bills get stuck. Neither would necessarily resolve the political stalemate.

But with his voter support sagging at around 30 percent, opposition parties have shown little inclination to compromise -- something S&P highlighted when explaining its reasons for the downgrade. Signaling their intent, opposition parties boycotted the first session of the budget debate in the lower house on Friday. The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party plans to boycott the debate again next week, the party's head of parliamentary affairs was quoted by Kyodo news agency as saying.
