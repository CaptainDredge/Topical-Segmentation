In deciding on the size of BlackRock's fine, the FSA said it had granted a 30 percent discount because the fund manager decided to settle early. The regulator also took into account that the error was not deliberate and no clients had suffered a loss. (Editing by Mike Nesbit and  Mark Potter )

"Despite being part of one of the largest asset managers in the world, BIM's systems were simply not adequate," said Tracey McDermott, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime. New York-headquartered BlackRock said it had reported the error to the FSA after identifying the issue through an internal review. It has since taken steps to ensure it has robust systems and controls in place, including establishing a dedicated team to oversee its obligations to clients' money.

SEVENTH BIGGEST FINE The fine is the seventh largest handed out by the FSA, and the latest in a number of high-profile penalties it has slapped on investment management firms this year. In May British and U.S. regulators fined asset manager Martin Currie a combined 8.6 million pounds for failing to manage a conflict of interest between two of its clients.

The FSA's 3.5 million pound fine was the largest ever imposed in a conflict of interest case. In January, hedge fund boss David Einhorn was fined 3.64 million pounds and his firm Greenlight Capital 3.65 million pounds by the British watchdog for alleged trading abuses. Banks still dominate the top of the FSA's biggest fines list, however, with Barclays' 59.5 million pounds for rigging interbank lending rates the largest yet.
