BP said the sale will generate $1.058 billion plus future payments which, dependent on oil price and production, are expected to exceed $250 million. BP will sell TAQA its interests in the Harding (70 percent), Maclure (37.03 percent), and Devenick (88.7 percent) fields in the Central North Sea. TAQA will also increase its non-operated interests in the Brae area and associated transport infrastructure including the SAGE system, Forties-Brae and Forties-Braemar pipelines.

TAQA also operates the Brent Pipeline System. "This investment shows our commitment to the future of the North Sea. It is underpinned by the UK Government's commitment to long term fiscal stability," said Hamad al Hurr al Suwaidi, chairman of TAQA. TAQA, which has investments in the energy and power sector from India to the Middle East and Canada, aims to spend around $2 billion per year on capital investments.

The sale suggests BP could still win back its positions in the UAE, where the oil giant played a big role from the start of the oil industry in the early 1930s. For TAQA, the deal is important as it boosts access to North Sea production, home to the global oil benchmark Brent.
