In recession-hit Japan, half of companies plan to freeze salaries. Globally, average salaries should increase 4.7 percent this year, down from a 6.2 percent rise in 2008, the survey shows. "The economic upheaval since last September has prompted many firms to revise salary increases significantly from previous predictions," said Lee Quane, ECA's Asia director.

Salaries in mainland China will hold up because of a talent shortage whereas pay in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and China's special autonomous region of Hong Kong, which are all in recession, will be marginal if at all, although the slowdown will be partly offset by receding inflation in Asia. Salaries in Singapore and Hong Kong will increase by 2 percent, the same as in Western Europe, while in Eastern Europe they will increase by just under 5 percent.
