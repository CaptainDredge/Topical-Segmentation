For that reason, many warned investors not to infer too much from IBM's strong earnings and full-year outlook, made possible by cost cuts and a shift to higher-margin services rather, or from Intel's results which were bolstered by consumer, rather than corporate, demand. Analysts advised that investors were better off focusing on IBM's 13 percent drop in quarterly sales, which Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said may suggest "corporate IT spending has not improved, and may not even fully be at bottom." Juniper Networks Inc kicks off the reporting season for major U.S. network equipment makers on Thursday, and analysts expect second-quarter revenue of $765 million, down 13 percent from a year ago and barely higher than the previous quarter's $764 million, according to Reuters Estimates.

He said that while few believed Cisco could achieve its long-term revenue growth target of 12 to 17 percent a year any time soon, he thought it could eventually achieve growth of 10 to 12 percent. Analysts on average forecast Cisco to report fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $8.49 billion, down 18 percent from a year earlier but up 4 percent from the previous quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.

Top U.S. phone companies like AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) have reined in their capital spending so far this year, but analysts said that was likely temporary. "Ongoing traffic growth won't allow carriers to penny-pinch forever," said Morgan Keegan's Simon Leopold. Analysts also say Cisco and Juniper have handled the downturn well, controlling their operating costs while investing in new products and acquiring small companies, particularly compared with rivals like Alcatel-Lucent ( ALUA.PA ).

Even the more cautious analysts see long-term demand for switches and routers, and in Cisco's case a wider range of network equipment and software products, remaining solid. Increasing use of the Web for downloading videos, uploading photos to share with friends, and the shift of more business processes like accounting and sales to online systems, mean both large companies and phone carriers will continue upgrading their networks in the long term, they said.

Some said upbeat comments about the coming quarters by executives like Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers could bolster investors' confidence, even if results do not. Credit Suisse analyst Paul Silverstein on Monday raised his rating on Cisco to "outperform" from "neutral," hiking its share price target to $25 from $22, as he forecast greater visibility, particularly in North America.
