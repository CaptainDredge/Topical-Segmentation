President Barack Obama will make remarks on Wednesday on "his comprehensive plan for new rules of the road for the financial industry," a White House official said. Geithner will joint him at the event. The Treasury secretary and Summers said that a key administration goal will be "raising capital and liquidity requirements for all institutions, with more stringent requirements for the largest and most interconnected firms." In addition, they said, large and interconnected firms whose failure could threaten the stability of the system "will be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, and we will establish a council of regulators with broader coordinating responsibility across the financial system." These dual proposals -- making the Fed a "systemic risk" regulator and creating a related inter-agency council in the same area -- come amid concerns by some lawmakers and other regulators about the Fed getting too much power.

It also said the plan will call for a new mechanism for "the orderly resolution of any financial holding company whose failure might threaten the stability of the financial system." This "resolution authority" proposal was sketched out earlier by the administration in draft legislation that would confer these powers on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Administration officials have argued a rewrite of U.S. financial rules is needed to prevent future crises. The outline offered few new details on elements of the plan that were already known and sidestepped unanswered questions about streamlining bank supervision, restraining executive pay and regulating over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. But it did clearly underline the administration's determination to give the Fed a central role, and to create a new way for the federal government to handle troubled firms whose failure could pose a risk to the economy.

The two officials outlined the plan in The Washington Post ahead of the release on Wednesday of a detailed package of proposals that has been under discussion for six months. Months of debate in Congress over the plan lie ahead, with time on the side of the status quo, especially if the economy continues to improve and public outrage at the banks begins to fade.
