The report by the Mortgage Bankers Association of a fourth straight week of declines in applications for loans to buy homes also suggested housing would remain at depressed levels for some time. PUZZLING GAIN IN THE WEST Economists were puzzled by the surge in new-home sales in the West, given that the region has suffered the highest rate of foreclosures.

Housing, which was the main trigger of the worst recession since the 1930s, is lagging the broader economy's recovery. Though sales of previously owned homes surged in December, further progress could be frustrated by a glut of homes from an unrelenting wave of foreclosures. The supply glut, in turn, has been pressuring prices, which have resumed a downward slide and could soon test new lows.

But investors said the report was a further sign the U.S. economic recovery was strengthening and broadening. Prices for U.S. government debt fell sharply, and stocks on Wall Street traded higher. The dollar was little changed against the euro. Federal Reserve officials gave a lukewarm assessment of the economy at the end of a two-day meeting and said the recovery was at a pace "insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions." The U.S. central bank said high unemployment still justified its $600 billion bond-buying program to aid the recovery.

The availability of cut-rate distressed properties would normally draw strength away from the new-homes market. "Clearly the economy in California still faces serious problems, and state and local employees are likely to feel the pain," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in New York. "This suggests that what may be happening in the West is the backlog of foreclosed properties may suddenly be working their way through the course and freeing up sales.

I am being very cautious in extrapolating the recent spike in sales to a broader economic recovery in housing." Others speculated the jump in sales in the West, which was also ravaged by December floods, could have been the result of buyers rushing to take advantage of a statewide homebuyer tax credit.
