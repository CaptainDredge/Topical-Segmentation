"As a result, smoke generated by the APU battery could not be effectively redirected outside the cabin and aft (electrical equipment) bay," located in the fuselage behind the right wing of the 787. Boeing had said that the venting system failed because the plane was on the ground and lacked cabin pressure to use in expelling fumes from the cabin.

The NTSB report, while marking a milestone in the probe of the Boston fire, also signaled that the NTSB has significant additional work to do in its investigation. The NTSB said a group focused on system safety and certification was going through records of testing and analysis performed by Boeing and its suppliers, system maker Thales SA of France, and battery maker GS Yuasa Corp of Japan.

A second incident in Japan a few days later prompted regulators worldwide to ban the 787 from commercial flight on January 16, a restriction costing Boeing and airlines millions of dollars a day. "It's unusual to have hearings when you haven't had a major incident," said John Hansman, co-chairman of an FAA advisory committee and a professor of aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Such "unprecedented public scrutiny" of the battery, he said, tends to slow down the process and make people behave more conservatively.

(Reuters) - A safety regulator on Thursday released hundreds of pages of details from its probe of a battery fire aboard Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, but the information did not reveal what caused the January blaze, and a call for hearings on the matter could slow efforts to get the plane back in the air.The National Transportation Safety Board said it would hold two public meetings in April, one on the design and certification of Boeing 787's battery system, and a second on general lithium-ion battery technology the same month.

The report also suggests that the NTSB is looking at whether the FAA, and its designees who work at Boeing, had the technical knowledge to critically question test data used to show the failure rate for the battery was acceptably low. "The FAA will be under scrutiny to demonstrate that the guys responsible for signing off on these things at Boeing had the levels of knowledge to be able to identify shortcomings for correction prior to the airplane being certified," said Feith, a partner at Media and Communications Strategies consulting firm in Washington, D.C. Over the past eight years, the FAA has outsourced much of its oversight of Boeing and other aircraft makers to so called "designees" who work for the companies but have the power to certify work on the FAA's behalf.
