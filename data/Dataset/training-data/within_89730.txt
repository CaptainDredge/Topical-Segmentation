Assured is seeking $116 million in damages. Similar lawsuits by insurers including Assured, MBIA Inc.( MBI.N ) and Ambac Financial Group IncABKFQ.PK are pending against banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co( JPM.N ), Credit Suisse Group AG( CSGN.VX ) and Bank of America Corp's( BAC.N ) Countrywide Financial unit. The case against Flagstar was the first of those lawsuits to reach trial.

Stewart Aaron, another lawyer for Flagstar, also criticized Assured's method of estimating damages. Assured relied on a statistical analysis of a handful of the 16,000 loans underlying the two transactions. But Aaron said Assured relied on an "insufficient sample size." Flagstar said in its earning announcement October 23 that it was increasing its litigation reserves by $40 million to address its exposure to "pending and threatened litigation." Paul Borja, Flagstar's chief financial officer, declined on an analyst conference call the next day to say whether the reserve increase was attributable to Assured's lawsuit.

Rendon said Assured had failed to establish that Flagstar was aware of various loan breaches that required repurchasing. For example, online search tools such as Salary.com were used to determine expected incomes for the careers of various borrowers in the securitizations. But Rendon said the websites had only contemporaneous data, not salaries for the period when the loans were originated more than six years ago.
