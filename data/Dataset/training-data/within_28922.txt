Release of the funds -- to buy items that take a long time to produce -- are required for a contract Lockheed hopes to sign by November 27. Providing the bridge funding is a "prudent and necessary action" to sustain F-22 production until March 15, 2009 -- by when the Obama team is expected to decide, the House lawmakers said.

A spokesman for the deputy defense secretary had no immediate comment. Last week, Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the Defense Department "is committed to bridging F-22 production to preserve options for the next administration." Lockheed anticipates the Pentagon will release the funds to preserve the production line pending a final decision on the aircraft by the incoming administration, its chief executive, Robert Stevens, said Sunday during a visit to Israel.

"Anything short of this will cause suppliers to quickly stop F-22-related work, begin shutting down the lines and laying off a national high-tech work force of over 25,000 in the midst of a severe economic downturn," the senators wrote. The letter was signed by Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, where the F-22 undergoes final assembly; Orrin Hatch of Utah; John Thune of South Dakota; James Inhofe of Oklahoma; and John Cornyn of Texas.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Six Republican senators have joined a tug-of-war with the Pentagon over bridge funds for Lockheed Martin Corp's ( LMT.N ) top-of-the-line F-22 Raptor fighter until President-elect Barack Obama decides its fate.In a November 3 letter to Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England, the senators pressed for the immediate release of $140 million provided by Congress as a kind of downpayment on a possible batch of 20 more F-22s.

"There is a discussion ongoing now in the Pentagon as to how to place that $140 million," Stevens told Reuters. "I have confidence that it will be placed under contract." Leaders of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee warned Defense Secretary Robert Gates on October 31 that time was running out.
