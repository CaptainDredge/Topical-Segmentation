Mehta, a trained lawyer who began his career at United Technologies' Otis Elevator unit, said the lingering uncertainty about future budgets was frustrating, but his company was focused on continuing to deliver those helicopters already on order to the U.S. military on time and on budget. "There's no shield against sequestration, but hopefully when they go through the process - if they go through the process ...

He said Pentagon officials also recognized that they could not continually ask industry to invest time and money to prepare bids for competitions only to see programs get cancelled. "They've taken a really pragmatic, cost-effective approach," he said. "That provides us with a little more confidence that they won't back away from these programs once they've started." Sikorsky also sees strong growth in international markets in coming years, especially in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Mehta said, noting that a majority of the helicopters in use around the world were over 20 years old.

But he said the new aircraft would give the Army far more capabilities than it has now. Other helicopter makers, including Europe's EADS ( EAD.PA ), which has a new helicopter called the X3, and AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ), have also urged the Army to launch a new development program.

Most defense companies expect revenue to come under pressure in coming years after more than a decade of growth in military spending. However, they do not forecast sudden declines in January, since most weapons deals stretch over many years. The 87-year-old Sikorsky is also investing heavily to develop its new S-97 Raider helicopter in hopes that the U.S. Army will decide later this year to buy a new helicopter to replace its aging OH-58 Kiowa Warriors, rather than upgrade the existing fleet.

Army officials are expected to reach a decision about the issue in coming weeks, although the decision will still need approval by top Pentagon acquisition officials. Mehta said he did not expect the Air Force and Navy to back off their new helicopter competitions, both of which come after failed earlier programs, given the increased age of the current fleets, which is driving up maintenance costs, and the Pentagon's increased focus on affordable programs.
