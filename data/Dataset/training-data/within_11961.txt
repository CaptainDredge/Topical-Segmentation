A Fed spokesman declined to comment on the rumor. The Fed's next policy meeting is scheduled for October 30-31. Markets widely expect the U.S. central bank to cut the benchmark interbank federal funds rate by at least a quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent. Treasuries rallied on the weak housing data but came off session highs in afternoon trading as stocks pared losses.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The housing market took a sharp turn for the worse in September as prices tumbled and sales of previously owned homes fell to a record low, battered by rising foreclosures and tighter lending standards.Sales of existing homes dropped 8 percent to a 5.04 million unit annual pace in September, the lowest on record dating to 1999, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday.

The dollar was off slightly against a basket of currencies. The National Association of Realtors pinned September's sales weakness on a tightening of credit in August, which was sparked by concerns over rising foreclosures on U.S. subprime mortgages extended to borrowers with spotty borrowing histories. "Mortgage problems were peaking back in August when many of the September closings were being negotiated, and that slowed sales notably in higher-priced areas that rely more on jumbo loans," said Lawrence Yun, an economist for the realty trade group, adding that mortgage availability has improved in recent weeks.

Mortgage applications last week were 11.5 percent above their year-ago level, even though existing- and new-home sales are both down sharply. The deep slump in the housing market has led many U.S. lawmakers to look for ways to help Americans who have found themselves in homes they cannot afford. Fed Governor Randall Kroszner cautioned Congress on Wednesday against taking any action that might restrict credit availability and adversely impact the ability of lenders to repackage loans as securities for resale to investors.

This suggests that the decline is accelerating and that the downside risk is certainly significant." Stocks tumbled on the housing data and on a report by Merrill Lynch of its first loss in nearly five years as a result of write-downs related to mortgage market problems, but pared most losses on a rumor the Federal Reserve would imminently cut its discount rate, the rate it charges banks for loans.
