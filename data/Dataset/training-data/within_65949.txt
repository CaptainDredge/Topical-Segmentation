"So what used to be an advantage has been turned into a distinct disadvantage and in a way that nobody could ever have thought about two weeks ago. "David Cameron's association with News International is closer than his (Stephenson's) was, and it's a very big political problem." "We know he was seeing (Coulson) two months after he resigned.

LONDON  (Reuters) - Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson resigned on Sunday following criticism of the handling by police of a phone hacking scandal that has rocked British politics and shaken Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media empire.Following are reactions to the news: PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON (STATEMENT): "Sir Paul Stephenson has had a long and distinguished career in the police, and I would like to thank him for his service over many, many years.

That cannot be right, in terms of the scale of the crisis that now faces the country. At the very least the House of Commons needs to sit for longer this week, and the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and others need to answer some fundamental questions." JONATHAN TONGE, PROFESSOR OF POLITICS, LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY: "If the head of Metropolitan Police can resign because of a connection, because of a foolhardy decision to appoint someone connected to the News of the World as their PR adviser, which is a spectacularly foolish thing to do, then it highlights frankly the abject decision-making by David Cameron in terms of appointing Andy Coulson.

I think he's been badly let down." "He's been quite honourable in saying he just needs to clear himself out of the way and allow someone to come in. Officers that have held information from Sir Paul Stephenson about the scale of the phone hacking and the scale of unacceptable relationships between members of the police and News Corporation, they have got to go." LONDON MAYOR BORIS JOHNSON (STATEMENT) "It is with great sadness and reluctance that I have tonight accepted the resignation of Sir Paul Stephenson as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service.

And we know that his association with Rebekah Brooks is very close, so I think what it suggests to me is that if somebody has resigned because the publicist for the place that he happened to stay at was with News International, David Cameron has got many more reasons to resign, if we think that is a legitimate thing." YVETTE COOPER, OPPOSITION Labor SPOKESWOMAN ON HOME AFFAIRS (SHADOW HOME SECRETARY) "It is striking that Sir Paul has taken responsibility and answered questions about the appointment of the deputy editor of the News of the World whereas the prime minister still refuses to recognize his misjudgment and answer questions on the appointment of the editor of the News of the World at the time of the initial phone hacking investigation." "People will wonder at why different rules apply for the prime minister and the Met, especially when as Sir Paul said himself, unlike Andy Coulson, Neil Wallis had not been forced to resign from the News of the World." "It is also a very serious concern that the Met commissioner felt unable to tell the prime minister and the home secretary about this operational issue with Neil Wallis because of the prime minister's relationship with Andy Coulson.
