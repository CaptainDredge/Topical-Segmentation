DETROIT  (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) 2009 decision to grant Fisker Automotive a $529 million loan will be heavily scrutinized on Wednesday during a congressional hearing that is being held as the automaker verges on collapse.Among the key questions is whether Fisker's prospects were strong enough at the start to warrant the DOE's backing, which helped trigger a flood of private financing for Fisker.

Fisker's failure to make a payment on the DOE loan Monday is the latest of its troubles. In recent weeks, Fisker has fired 75 percent of its workforce and hired bankruptcy advisors. It has not built a car since July. "The Obama Administration owes the American taxpayer an explanation as to why this bad loan was made in the first place, and what they are going to do to minimize the loss that taxpayers face," said Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, chairman of the subcommittee holding Wednesday's hearing.

Lawmakers may raise questions about the relationship between the DOE and Fisker, which has been strained in recent months, people familiar with the matter have said. The terms of Fisker's pact with the DOE were enough to put off potential suitors, including Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd ( 0175.HK ).

The House Oversight and Government Reform committee will hear testimony from Henrik Fisker, who founded Fisker in 2007 and abruptly resigned as executive chairman in March. Nicholas Whitcombe, supervisory senior investment officer for the DOE loan program and Fisker co-founder Bernhard Koehler will also testify. The DOE's early public support helped open doors for Fisker, which sells the $100,000-plus Karma plug-in hybrid sports car.

Fisker has raised $1.2 billion in private funds to date, according to SEC filings. The 2009 loan signaled that the DOE had done a rigorous review of the project, said Salo Zelermyer, a senior counsel at the DOE under the Bush administration and who also helped create the auto loan program.
