That was slightly more than the 0.1 percent decrease that economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast for sales in April. * But excluding autos, April sales were up 0.5 percent after a 0.4 percent March pickup - significantly better than the 0.2 percent sales increase that had been anticipated. * The Federal Reserve has cut official interest rates 3-1/4 percentage points to 2 percent since last September to shield the economy from a credit crunch sparked by the housing crisis, hoping to keep consumers from choking off spending that fuels two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

The headline number declined but it was entirely an auto story, which was to be expected. Outside autos, the spending is certainly above expectations and it seems to be widespread. It's consistent with the Fed on hold for the near-term, and it does suggest growth will be a little stronger in the first and second quarters." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR &  ASSOCIATES, TORONTO, CANADA: "The retail sales data and what Bernanke had to say I think indicate that the Fed won't be cutting rates.

They thought it would be off a little bit for the month. The key here is ex-autos and gas, the number was up a fair amount.

COMMENTS: ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE CORP,  BOSTON: "The retail sales number is pretty much what people thought.

"If you take the ex-autos, building materials and gas reading, up 0.4 percent for the month, that number feeds right into the consumption categories of GDP. My expectation was that that number would probably be weaker than what it was. "It puts first quarter consumer spending on a much better footing than would have anticipated and with regard to expecting a contraction of activity in the first quarter this kind of argues against that." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL  RESEARCH, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "You have the consumer still spending, albeit meekly, as indicated by the ex-autos retail sales." "Inflation as seen in the import prices, still rears its ugly head and will remain a concern concentrated in the long end of the Treasury market." RON SIMPSON, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, ACTION  ECONOMICS, TAMPA, FLORIDA: "U.S. retail sales ex-autos were better-than-expected and that helped the dollar.
