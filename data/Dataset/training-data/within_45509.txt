"After a year of hearings and investigations, it is past time for this Committee to hold Secretary Geithner accountable for his decisions that have affected the lives of millions of Americans," said Issa and fellow Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry said in a statement. Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, asked the panel's chairman, Democrat Barney Frank, to hold a similar hearing on the AIG emails, citing a "calculated attempt to withhold important information from the public and market participants." Frank told Reuters he had not decided whether to hold a hearing, and said he believed Republicans were making a "partisan attack" on Geithner by requesting his testimony and not that of two other key figures in the AIG bailout, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.

"More than one year after the first Federal bailout of AIG, the American people continue to question where their tax dollars were really sent when the government rescued this company," Towns, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. A Treasury spokesman declined comment on whether Geithner would agree to the request.

The calls for Geithner to testify were joined by one Democrat on Friday. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who has been critical of the AIG bailout, called for a full investigation into the matter. "It is critical that we understand if the FRBNY did request the withholding of information and what the extent and nature of the pressure exerted by the FRBNY on AIG may have been," Cummings wrote in a letter to Towns requesting a hearing.

Both Paulson and Bernanke were appointed by the Bush administration. Frank also reaffirmed his confidence in Geithner, adding "I think that Geither and Bernanke have done a good job of helping us get out from under this crisis." White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, asked by reporters whether Geithner still had President Barack Obama's full confidence, said, "of course." "Secretary Geithner was not involved in any of these e-mails," Gibbs said, confirming a statement on Thursday by a Treasury spokeswoman.

A total of $62 billion in payments to specific counterparties was later disclosed in March 2009. Geithner was president of the New York Fed at the time of the September 2008 bailout and when the email traffic started in late November 2008. Republicans took advantage of the emails to bash Geithner's handling of the bailout, which has stoked rage over billions of dollars paid to banks and millions in bonuses paid to AIG executives after the insurer's near collapse.
