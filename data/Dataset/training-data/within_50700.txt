BUSAN, South Korea  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner urged his Group of 20 counterparts to keep stoking global growth to counteract Europe's woes and put the onus on China, Germany and Japan to boost domestic demand.In a June 3 letter released on Saturday as a G20 gathering of finance ministers and central bankers got underway, Geithner urged policy makers of the world's leading developed and emerging economies to "safeguard recovery and strengthen prospects for growth." "The G20's strong policy response to the crisis has played a pivotal role in restoring economic growth, but concerns about growth as Europe makes needed policy adjustments threaten to undercut the momentum of the recovery," he wrote.

Geithner urged the G20 ministers and central bankers to accelerate progress on financial reforms, including a new framework for bank capital requirements. He said details on this -- including specifics on overall capital and leverage ratios, the length of a transition period and liquidity requirements, should be finished by the November G20 leaders summit in Seoul.
