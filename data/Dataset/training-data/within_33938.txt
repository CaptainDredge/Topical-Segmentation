WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's budget plan for fiscal year 2010 gives more money to NASA and spends more on space overall, officials said on Thursday.It gives the U.S. space agency $18.7 billion, a rise of $2.4 billion over 2008 when money from the economic stimulus package is included, and stresses research into climate change and space exploration.

Just this week a NASA satellite that was supposed to monitor carbon dioxide emissions crashed into the Pacific Ocean when it failed to separate from its rocket, forcing the space agency to reevaluate its plans to measure the greenhouse gas from space. "NASA will develop new space-based research sensors in support of the administration's goal to deploy a global climate research and monitoring system," the budget reads.

Funding for military space programs would increase by $3 billion, said one administration official who asked not to be identified. Like his predecessor George W. Bush, Obama wants to return people to the moon and send robots further into space. He will also, as planned, retire the space shuttle in 2010, adding perhaps one extra flight between now and then if possible to help complete the International Space Station.

Acting NASA Administrator Christopher Scolese called the proposal "fiscally responsible." Others were disappointed. "The budget proposal for NASA represents a disappointingly small step in the right direction. It is far from what is needed if the U.S. is to stimulate the economy, create more high-tech jobs and hold on to its eroding leadership position in space," Space Foundation Chief Executive Officer Elliot Pulham said in a statement.
