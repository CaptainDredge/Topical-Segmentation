The deadline for the Japanese banks to respond is nextweek, the Nikkei said. The banks are seen acknowledging that it is in their bestinterest to help their U.S. counterparts to recover from thecredit crunch triggered by subprime mortgage problems. But they realize that contributing funds without thoroughlyassessing the risks would prompt objections from shareholders,the Nikkei said.

TOKYO  (Reuters) - Three Japanese banks that have been askedto provide $5 billion each to a subprime support fund plannedby U.S. banks have balked at what they see as an unreasonablyhigh figure, the Nikkei business daily reported on Saturday.Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, a unit of Sumitomo MitsuiFinancial Group Inc ( 8316.T ), and Mizuho Corporate Bank, whichis part of Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ), appear reluctant toprovide the requested amount, the Nikkei reported, withoutnaming any sources.

The fund has faced skepticism from market players whobelieve that it will buy only high-quality assets, which woulddo little to help weaker SIVs, which are off-balance-sheetfunds banks use to buy assets like U.S. mortgages. With fewer subprime-related investments than their overseasrivals, Japanese lenders have so far avoided heavy subprimelosses, although some have been forced to write down the valueof some investments.

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( 8306.T ), which has a U.S.presence through its unit UnionBanCal Corp, is also expected toask for a reduction in the amount, it added. Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ) and JPMorgan Chase( JPM.N ) are heading an effort to raise billions of dollars forthe new fund, which will buy assets from failing structuredinvestment vehicles (SIVs) as a way to ease turmoil in thecredit markets.
