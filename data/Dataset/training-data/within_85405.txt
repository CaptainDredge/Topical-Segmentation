WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. tax authorities took no formal action after launching a probe five years ago of tax strategies used by private equity managers at firms such as Bain Capital LLC, leaving a legal gray area that is now being examined by New York's attorney general.In a move focusing more scrutiny on private equity at a politically turbulent time, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has subpoenaed documents from at least a dozen firms about how they reduce their managers' tax bills, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Fleischer, a critic of the tax strategy, said a 2006 Romney financial disclosure shows more than $1 million in income from a Bain fund that has received converted management fees. On the broader issue of carried interest, Democrats have been trying for years to close what they see as a tax break.

Romney's campaign said he did not take part in the fee-waiver program. Bain declined to comment. The IRS said in November 2007 it was studying tax techniques used by alternative investment firms, including private equity. "The service never said anything after that," said Francois Hechinger, a partner in the private equity tax practice at accounting firm BDO in California.

"It has been this open secret in the private equity world." DEMOCRATS TRIED PREVIOUSLY The timing of the probe and Schneiderman's credentials as a Democrat could raise eyebrows in political circles. Romney has not said how he would handle the issue, but Ryan voted several times against the Democrats' bid to change the tax treatment in the House.

They came closest in 2010 when they controlled the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House. Still, they failed, in large part because some Senate Democrats tried to carve out exceptions for certain industries. After the upcoming elections, wide-ranging tax code reform is seen by some on Capitol Hill as a possibility in 2013.
