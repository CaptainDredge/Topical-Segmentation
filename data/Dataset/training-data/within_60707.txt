JX resumed oil product shipments from its 270,000 barrels per day Negishi refinery south of Tokyo, the company said, though supply would be limited until the restart of the refinery was completed. Japan is likely to turn to oil -- mainly low-sulphur fuel oil or low-sulphur crudes such as Indonesia's Duri -- as replacement power-generation fuel in the wake of the earthquake that resulted in the closure of several nuclear plants.

Japan is the top buyer of Indonesian coal, accounting for 21 percent of Bumi's sales in 2011. STEEL FIRMS STOP PRODUCTION ON OUTAGES Steel prices in Asia are likely to rise after the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan's steel mills, constraining exports from the world's second largest producer, analysts say. JFE said shipments from its 10 million tonnes per year Higashi Nihon plant near Tokyo had been virtually halted by a power outage.[ID:nTFD006676] JFE, which has total production capacity of about 32 million tonnes, resumed operations on Sunday of two blast furnaces at its Higashi Nihon plant, one of its two mainstay plants, which were idled after Friday's quake and tsunami.

That's why Tokyo premiums are a bit higher," said a dealer at a bullion trading house in Tokyo. Japan must act quickly to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) and low-sulphur fuels to generate power at thermal plants and replace nuclear electricity supplies put out of action by the quake. Significant power supplies in Japan, which ranks third in terms of oil imports and size of its economy, were crippled by the earthquake, causing the loss of an estimated 9,700 megawatts (MW) of nuclear, about a fifth of capacity, and 10,831 MW of thermal power generation.

The northeast coast ports of Hachinohe, Sendai, Ishinomaki and Onahama were so severely damaged that they were not expected to return to operation for months. But power outages and fires resulting from the earthquake present an immediate risk. Top refiner JX Nippon Oil and Energy Corp waited in hopes of extinguishing later on Monday a fire at a 145,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Sendai that it had been unable to fight because of tsunami warnings and refinery staff evacuation.
