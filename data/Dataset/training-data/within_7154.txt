"We think it is a reasonable offer to take under consideration." The Financial Times earlier quoted Brian Rogers, the chairman and chief investment officer of T.

"I find it hard to believe the company itself has a plan to get the shares to $60," the Financial Times quoted Rogers saying.

A spokesman for T. Rowe Price told Reuters the offer should be considered, but stressed the firm had not directly appealed to the Bancroft family, which controls 64.2 percent of voting shares. "We've said all along that, as long-term investors in Dow Jones stock, we're gratified that other investors have recognized the value that we always thought was there," the press officer said.
