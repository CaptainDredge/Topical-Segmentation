"We need to expand." For VW, whose brands include luxury division Audi, operational integration doesn't stop at handling overflow production of Boxster and Cayman models. The Wolfsburg-based car manufacturer already makes the bodies for the Cayenne SUV and Panamera sedan, Porsche's two best-selling vehicles, at its plants in Bratislava and Hanover.

A notification from regional tax authorities published this month suggests that VW would soon be able to complete the deal with zero costs thanks to a tax loophole. Critics are now urging the German government to scrap the tax break. As Porsche keeps shouldering about 1.5 billion euros of debt, the car makers are keen to join forces as soon as possible because they are wasting around 700 million euros a year on idle synergies in purchasing and development, VW has said.

"Capacities always have their limits and flexibility is the name of the game," he said. Meanwhile, VW supplier Bergmann, like Titgemeyer, expects higher orders to result from the VW-Porsche alliance. Bergmann, based in Meppen, 74km (46 miles) northwest of Osnabrueck, assembles engine parts for luxury auto makers. "VW and Porsche offer tremendous business opportunities," said Hermann Jungsthoefel, the company's deputy managing director.

The sports-car maker is widely known for lean production techniques that companies including aviation group Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and steelmaker ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ) seek to emulate. Production of Porsche models at the Osnabrueck facility will be restricted to vehicles that cannot be made at the Zuffenhausen plant for capacity reasons.

The Cayenne is based on the same technology platform as the VW Touareg and the Audi Q7, while Porsche's next model, the Macan compact SUV (to be sold from 2014), will share the same underbody as the Audi Q5. "Joint production is part of VW's broader strategy to wring out more profit by sharing development, manufacturing and component costs across its multiple brands," said Christoph Stuermer, Frankfurt-based analyst at research firm IHS Automotive.
