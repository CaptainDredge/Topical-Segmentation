On Wall Street, U.S. stocks racked up their best one-day gain in over a year on Monday with the Dow  .DJI  ending up 3.9 percent and the S&P 500  .SPX  gaining 4.4 percent. The Nasdaq  .IXIC  rose 4.8 percent. The bailout package approved by European leaders early on Monday drove the S&P 500 to its highest opening gain on record as indexes crossed back into positive territory for the year after last week's sharp slide wiped out year-to-date gains.

McKhann noted that institutional traders were betting on lower volatility as many sold put options in the S&P 500 and bought puts on the VIX, suggesting lower volatility index levels. VIX FUTURES REFLECT SLIGHTLY LOWER VOLATILITY VIX futures from May to December traded in the 27 to 28 range. "That tells us that traders are betting on slightly lower volatility going forward," McKhann noted.

The VIX is a 30-day risk forecast of stock market volatility and typically has an inverse relationship with the S&P benchmark. The drop in the VIX "doesn't mean the people are not all of a sudden not fearful at all. But the rescue package, the coordinated efforts of the market are giving fewer reasons to invest in options," said Steve Claussen, chief investment strategist at online brokerage OptionsHouse.com in Chicago.

It is also the first time the index has risen more than 20 percent in one trading day and then declined more than 20 percent in the next session, according to Bespoke Investment Group, LLC. On Friday, the VIX closed at 40.95 -- its highest since April 2009. "Accommodating action from the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve helped to ease investor anxiety levels," said Frederic Ruffy, options strategist at web information site WhatsTrading.com.
