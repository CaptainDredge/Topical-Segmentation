WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Treasury Department official charged on Wednesday that forecasts of potential recession in the United States and globally were unnecessarily bleak, but noted that a housing downturn and market turmoil were weighing on prospects.David McCormick, Treasury's undersecretary for international affairs, said an International Monetary Fund forecast that said the U.S. will suffer a mild recession this year was "unduly pessimistic." He conceded at a press conference that "a significant downturn" was under way, but disputed the extent of the dip in growth that IMF foresaw.

Global markets have been in turmoil since August, when a crisis in U.S. subprime mortgage markets began rippling through the global economy and threatened to seize up credit markets. McCormick said the United States will urge members of the FSF, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Accounting Standards Board and other regulators, to speed up their efforts and conclude their work by year-end.

"Those numbers, in terms of the outlook for the United States in '08 and '09, as well as the outlook for other regions around the world were significantly below consensus," McCormick said. "Our hope and expectation is that we'll see the U.S. economy begin to move in a more positive direction toward the end of this year and be on an even steeper growth trajectory in 2009," he added.

In response to questions, McCormick said China has made progress in recent months in letting its yuan currency rise in value but needs to do more. "We believe China should accelerate its movement to a market-driven currency," he added. "We think it's still an important priority for addressing global imbalances." China is not a member of the G7, despite its rising importance in the global economy, but McCormick noted senior Chinese officials will be in town and that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson planned a bilateral meeting with China's Central Bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan.

McCormick acknowledged there were "downside risks" to the outlook from a severe U.S. housing downturn and market turmoil, but restated the Bush administration's position that it did not see the need for the use of public money to settle matters better left to the markets. NO PUBLIC MONEY "We think a very significant injection of public funding that essentially bails out speculators would not be a good use of taxpayer money and is frankly not something that we sense most Americans would support," McCormick said in response to a question, adding he did not think there was any consensus among G7 members for using public funds.
