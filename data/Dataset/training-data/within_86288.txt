MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain will attempt to step up its borrowing at a bond auction on Thursday, seeking to take advantage of investor bets on an imminent ECB bond-buying program that would support the market value of its debt.The Treasury said on Monday it would auction between 3.5 billion euros and 4.5 billion euros ($4.6 billion and $5.9 billion) of 12- and 18-month T-bills on Tuesday and the same amount in bonds later in the week.

"Rajoy saying last week that, since the spread has fallen, maybe a bailout wasn't needed, has not been taken very well by the market. The spread improved because everyone expects him to apply for aid," a Madrid-based trader said. "If he doesn't do it, the money starts to leave the country again." Spain is the center of the euro zone debt crisis, caught in a prolonged recession with almost 6 million unemployed draining social security funds as they search for work.

The ECB's announcement that it would buy sovereign debt on the secondary market if a country asked for European aid has brought down Spanish risk premiums to levels not seen since April. However, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's reticence about making such an application pushed yields on 10-year debt up by nearly 6 percent on Monday.

Spain has not attempted to raise more than 3.5 billion euros from a bond sale since early March when the market was flush with cheap credit from the European Central Bank's long-term refinancing operations (LTROs). The auction on Thursday includes a new bond maturing October 31, 2015, with a 3.75 percent coupon and the reopening of the benchmark 10-year bond, maturing January 31, 2022, with a 5.85 percent coupon.
