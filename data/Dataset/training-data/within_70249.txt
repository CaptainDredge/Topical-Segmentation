"It's just another nail in the coffin for the floor," said Chess Obermeier, a veteran corn options broker and trader at the Chicago Board of Trade. While nearly all CME futures are traded electronically, about 70 percent of options are still bought and sold on the trading floor. At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, 67 percent of contracts are traded electronically.

Floor traders queried on Tuesday said the way the tax break is structured makes them nervous, because trading is already migrating away from open outcry and to the computer screen. If electronic trades get a tax break, they said, exchanges will have even less of a reason to promote face-to-face trading.

The tax break is designed to help the exchange companies, and is not targeted directly at traders. Still, Obermeier worries, traders could get hit indirectly. "It's not going to have a big impact on us but it keeps pushing the momentum away from the pit." he said. It's unclear how much momentum the proposal has.

After months of negotiations with Governor Pat Quinn and state legislators, the exchanges appear to have clinched a tax cut for electronic trades, which account for the bulk of their trading. A bill introduced this week by Illinois Senate President John Cullerton would continue to subject all floor trades made in Chicago to the higher levy, but would tax just 27.5 percent of revenue from electronic trading and clearing.

The chief executive of CME, Craig Donohue, has said that the rise in the corporate tax rate -- to 7 percent from 4.8 percent -- puts CME in an "untenable" situation. CME, the biggest operator of U.S. futures exchanges, pays more taxes than any other corporation in the state, he said.
