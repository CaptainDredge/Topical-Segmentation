The analyst now expects Goldman to post a fourth-quarter loss of 49 cents per share, compared with his prior profit view of $2.98 per share. He also lowered his price target on the stock to $100 from $159 to reflect the fourth-quarter loss estimate and uncertainty on 2009 ROE. "With this 4Q loss, GS would have underperformed MS for 2 straight quarters in terms of ROE, and our forecast for2009 is for ROE of around 10 percent," Moszkowski said.

"We still think GS remains in many ways at the forefront of the capital markets industry, but if it can't consistently produce a premium return on equity (ROE), it's not going to be able to continue to have the premium valuation multiple that it has enjoyed," he wrote in a note to clients.

Goldman is particularly exposed to global equity market corrections due to its large corporate private-equity portfolio, equity proprietary trading business and exposure to Chinese equities through its stake in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd ( 601398.SS ) ( 1398.HK ), Moszkowski said. Both Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the global markets have corrected around 30 percent in last few weeks, likely driving more than a $2 billion mark in these positions, the analyst noted.

(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) will likely post a fourth-quarter loss, its first ever as a public company, due to the "stressed" equity environment over the past two months, which will also weigh on Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) quarterly results, Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski said.Moszkowski, however, said that Morgan Stanley should be in a relatively better position than Goldman because of its business mix -- limited private equity and very little proprietary equity trading at this point.

He cut Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter earnings estimate to 36 cents a share from 72 cents, mainly reflecting the expectation of another significant leveraged finance mark of $1.4 billion as spreads widened significantly in the quarter. Moszkowski continues to rate Goldman a "neutral," and Morgan Stanley a "buy." Shares of Goldman were up more than 2 percent at $94.61 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while those of Morgan Stanley were up about 5 percent at $18.34.
