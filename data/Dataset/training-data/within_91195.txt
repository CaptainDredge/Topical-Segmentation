At a summit in June, EU leaders pledged that once a common bank supervisor was in place, the bloc's rescue mechanism would have the power to directly recapitalize struggling institutions. Countries like France, Italy and Spain are keen for those powers to be in place as soon as possible. But Germany, worried it could be forced to foot the bill for struggling banks across the bloc, is not in a rush.

Britain has similar worries, although its finance minister signaled at the meeting that a deal was possible. George Osborne said one of his main concerns was avoiding a situation where the ECB might infringe on Britain's autonomy in monitoring the City of London, Europe's biggest financial centre. "It would be very difficult for us to accept that the ECB could exercise certain powers for Deutsche Bank in London.

That would be an unfair arrangement," Osborne said. All 27 EU states must give approval for the project to go ahead, even if only those countries in the euro zone will fall under the banking union to begin with. Under the Cypriot proposal, the ECB's Governing Council would keep the final say in supervision, but it also lays emphasis on the need for a clear operational separation between monetary policy and supervision.

Such a conflict could arise if, for example, the ECB were to keep interest rates low to prop up banks. But the tone of Wednesday's gathering was a far cry from a meeting last week intended to finalize the plan when Schaeuble clashed with Moscovici. France wanted a broad ECB remit, while Germany had reservations.

CYPRUS PROPOSAL A compromise document put forward by rotating EU President Cyprus, and obtained by Reuters on Tuesday, won broad backing at the meeting from the ECB and member states. In recent weeks, Germany had argued against giving the ECB supervisory responsibility for all 6,000 European banks, concerned the new system could become unmanageable.
