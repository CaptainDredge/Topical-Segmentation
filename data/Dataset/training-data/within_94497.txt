"Currently the property tightening campaign is at a critical stage, sentiment on rising home prices have strengthened," Friday's statement said. In February, average home prices in China's 100 biggest cities rose for the ninth straight month although the pace of increase slowed, a private survey showed on Friday. Rising home prices have reignited concerns about property inflation and analysts say local governments may announce plans to tighten property purchases after Beijing reiterated its pledge to calm the house market.

Economists at state-run think-tanks believe investors are right to be worried that the government is preparing to widen a pilot property tax as part of broader reform of land and fiscal policies. Sun Xuegong, an economist with a think-tank under the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, told Reuters this week that China urgently needs a blueprint to stabilize the real estate market.

He said that Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, set to take over as president and premier, respectively, at China's annual parliamentary meeting from March 5, would not shy from delivering one. Hui Jianqiang, the research head at E-House China, a real estate information provider in Shanghai, said Friday's State Council statement is more detailed than the sketchy guideline issued on February 20 "but it is still difficult for now to quantify the effect of the policy."
