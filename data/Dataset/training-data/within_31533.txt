Yet others said Satyam raised more general issues about India's corporate governance. "This raises serious doubts about the involvement of auditors and independent directors in the workings of a company," said Amar Ambani, vice president of research at brokerage India Infoline. "While it would be wrong to paint all companies with the same brush, in an already dull and bearish economic environment such events can have a prolonged impact on trade and sentiment." The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said it was shocked by Raju's admissions but felt it would be inappropriate to question the general governance standards of other companies.

That respect took a beating on Wednesday when B. Ramalinga Raju quit and said profits of India's fourth-biggest software exporter had been inflated over several years. "It's not exactly what India needed now," said Seema Desai, analyst for Asia at risk consultancy Eurasia Group in London. "It is a stark reminder that we need tighter rules."

"It's going to impact the outsourcing industry. Customers are going to get concerned about offshoring firms in India," said Sudin Apte, country head of research firm Forrester. Some saw little risk of similar problems among other companies.
