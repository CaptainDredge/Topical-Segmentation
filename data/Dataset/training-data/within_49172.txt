Shares of chief rival Avis Budget Group CAR.N also jumped. The deal marks a significant consolidation for the car rental industry, which is starting to recover from the global economic downturn, helped by a pickup in travel and the used car market. "This is a very important and strategic transaction for us in that it fills a gap in our product portfolio with a strong mid-tier value offering," Hertz Chief Executive Mark Frissora said on a conference call with analysts.

The combined company would have a market share of about 38 percent at the 190 largest U.S. airports, ahead of Enterprise's 31 percent and Avis's 29 percent. Last year, Hertz acquired some assets of smaller bankrupt rival Advantage Rent A Car to expand presence in the U.S. leisure rental market. In the three years ended December 31, 2009, Hertz increased the number of its off-airport rental locations in the United States by about 7 percent to some 1,700 locations.

Hertz said it expects the deal, comprising 80 percent cash and 20 percent stock, to immediately add to its annual adjusted earnings when completed. At the closing of the deal, Hertz will issue about 18 million shares of its common stock and pay about $750 million in cash, excluding a special $200 million Dollar Thrifty dividend, Hertz said.

They currently trade at 16.3 times forward earnings, an 8 percent premium to the company's peers, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimates. Dollar Thrifty, whose primary market is the United States, rents cars under the Dollar Rent A Car and Thrifty Car Rental brands.

Hertz said the combined company would have an overall U.S. market share of 23 percent. It trails privately held Enterprise Rent A Car which has a market share of 53 percent. Avis Budget has a share of 20 percent. "The Hertz brand will continue to be a commercial high-end travel brand, while Dollar Thrifty and (Hertz's) Advantage brands will continue to be used to penetrate leisure, summer, spring-break vacation travel," analyst John Healy of Northcoast Research said.
