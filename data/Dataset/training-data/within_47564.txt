Democratic Senator Robert Menendez told reporters on Tuesday that he hoped for bipartisan financial reform legislation by the end of the week. Dodd, sounding more cautious, told reporters after a lunch with fellow Democrats, "There's a tremendous amount of anger in the country over what people feel the financial service sector did to the country."
