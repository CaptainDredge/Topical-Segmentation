Fetting told an earnings conference call the money market funds had not warranted more write-downs since the charges taken at end-June and Legg was working to cut its exposure to risky securities in those funds. Legg said the exposure of money funds to structured investment vehicles, which are causing the write-downs, was down now to 2.2 percent of total money market assets from 2.6 percent at fiscal year-end.

"It's a two-week metric, but it's indicative of a rotation of market leadership," Fetting told Reuters in an interview. Miller's Value Trust, which is heavy on financials and light on energy, is down about 30 percent so far in 2008 and is at the bottom of its category. Legg reported a net loss of $31.3 million, or 22 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter ended June 30, compared with net income of $191 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.

Earnings per share rose to a slightly better than forecast 60 cents a share from 58 cents a year earlier, due to a lower number of shares outstanding. Its funds reported inflows of $8.1 billion in the quarter, lifting assets under management to $387.7 billion at the end of June from $378.6 billion at the end of March.
