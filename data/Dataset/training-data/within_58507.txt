LONDON  (Reuters) - Artificial knee and hip maker Smith & Nephew ( SN.L ) said on Friday it was not in talks on a merger or takeover, after a report it was weighing a deal with privately owned U.S. rival Biomet sent its shares higher.Speculation of a deal involving Biomet, which the Daily Telegraph said would be structured as a merger, followed an earlier report that a 7 billion pounds ($11 billion) bid from Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) had been rejected last month.

CONSOLIDATION REMAINS LIKELY Seymour Pierce analyst Mike Mitchell said the pressure on the company to issue a statement to the market had been quite substantial. Despite the denial, however, he said the rationale remained behind S&N being bought by a larger player, such as J&J, Zimmer ( ZMH.N ) or Stryker ( SYK.N ) -- which rank first, second and third in the market -- or doing a deal with a rival with a similar share, like Biomet.

"The bad news for shareholders is you massively increase the gearing levels of the group to take on all of Biomet's debt." Jantet also said a merger would rule out a takeover from a larger rival on competition grounds, removing the premium from the stock, and it would also focus the group on orthopaedics, the slowest-growing part of the business.

Investec analyst Seb Jantet, who moved to a "hold" from "buy" after the price spiked on Monday and no deal materialized, said a merger with Biomet would be less attractive than a potential cash bid. "The positive is it gives them scale in the orthopaedics market and there will be some cost savings, although those would be difficult to quantify at this stage," he said.

The British company, which also has woundcare and endoscopy units, has been tipped as a target for some time, although industry analysts say a takeover by a large U.S. rival like Biomet or J&J could run into antitrust issues. Shares in Smith & Nephew (S&N), which hit a record high of 739 pence on Monday after the report of the J&J bid, initially jumped as much as 4.6 percent on Friday on the Biomet merger report.
