Delinquencies are the first sign that consumers are having trouble paying their bills and indicators of future losses. The steady decline this year at the top U.S. credit-card lenders signals that American consumers have recovered from the worst of the financial crisis. "It's nice to see that consumers feel more confident in at least being able to pay their other bills," RBC Capital Markets analyst Jason Arnold said, adding that the October delinquency rates were slightly better than he had expected.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is increasingly competing with American Express for the most affluent credit card customers, said in a separate filing on Monday that its charge-off rate fell to 7.0 percent in October, from 7.78 percent in September.
