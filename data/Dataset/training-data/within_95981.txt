The companies said on Tuesday they could co-operate further in future and the announcement bolstered their share prices. Reliance Industries, whose main business is petrochemicals, made a dramatic return to telecoms in 2010 by becoming the only company to gain nationwide 4G airwaves. While it has yet to start services, it is widely expected to begin operations in parts of India later this year.

Reliance Communications shares jumped as much as 17 percent after the news before closing 11 percent higher. Other Anil Ambani group stocks also gained. Reliance Industries' stock closed up 2 percent. MORE CO-OPERATION Further details on the tie-up were not immediately available, but the companies indicated more cooperation was possible. Media reports have long speculated that Reliance Industries would lease space on Reliance Communications' tower network or buy an equity stake in the tower business.

The company has been looking to sell assets to cut its debt load but has fallen short in several attempts. "It is definitely a relief for Reliance Communications, and a relief coming to the group after a long, long time even though not sufficiently large," said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, strategist at SMC Global Securities in New Delhi.

"This agreement is the first in an intended comprehensive framework of business co-operation ... for optimal utilization of the existing and future infrastructure of both companies on reciprocal basis, including inter alia, inter-city fiber, intra-city fiber, towers and related assets," the companies said. Reliance Communications is the most leveraged among Indian cellular carriers with net debt of nearly $7 billion, or more than five times its annualized operating profit.

Tuesday's deal will help Reliance Jio Infocomm "reach the market faster," said Deven Choksey, managing director of K.R. Choksey Securities in Mumbai. According to Forbes, Mukesh Ambani is worth $21.5 billion, while Anil Ambani is worth $5.2 billion. Dhirubhai Ambani's death in 2002 led to a power struggle between his two sons that split the Reliance empire.
