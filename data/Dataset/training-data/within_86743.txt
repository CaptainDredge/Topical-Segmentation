The Madrid-based International Organization of Securities Commissions, a global regulator, also has a task force to study how the benchmark should be supervised and set to restore market confidence. Corporates are joining a chorus of other interested parties in demanding reform but no wholesale change. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the derivatives industry's leading global body, urged caution, arguing that the rate must not be scrapped hastily and any shift to alternatives should be gradual to avoid market disruption.

Floating rate loans or interest rate swaps used to manage the risk of interest rate volatility, will be benchmarked against a rate such as Libor. The British Bankers' Association estimates that loans amounting to $10 trillion globally are indexed to Libor. Libor consists of a "suite" of rates that banks estimate they would have to pay to borrow in different currencies over different periods of time.

Many others approached by Reuters declined to participate due to the sensitivity of the subject. Six out of 12 who used Libor, the London interbank offered rate, said they did not consider it an accurate benchmark against which to price their loans. But 10 out of 12 companies, representing a range of industries from mining to telecoms, said they would not consider changing to a different benchmark.

European lawmakers are questioning some of the world's top financial regulators in the European Parliament on Monday over the supervision of Libor. Gary Gensler, the chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will testify by video conference. Masamichi Kono, chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions will also attend.
