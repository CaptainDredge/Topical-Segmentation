Rival trader Noble Group Ltd ( NOBG.SI ), seen by many as one of the closest models to Glencore's on the trading side, saw earnings from its metals division recover in the second quarter after a dip in the first three months. On the industrial side, which includes Glencore's metals, energy and agricultural production, operating profit rose 54 percent, boosted by higher prices and increased gold and copper volumes, and the company is expected to benefit from ramped up production at key operations in the second half of the year.

"The second quarter has been tight (in oil trading), there has been massive volatility in the oil price and there was no trend in the business ... The opportunities, the fundamentals of the business did not present themselves," Glasenberg said. "The third quarter is starting as not bad, but it does not look like it will be in the region of the first quarter." Energy trading income fell 37 percent in the second quarter on the first, when it benefited from disruptions to the oil supply chain caused by the Japanese earthquake and Libya, but over the half, income was still more than double a year ago.

Wide of the mark comparisons had been made to proprietary trading operations of the investment banks, which were down (heavily) in the second quarter," analyst Dominic O'Kane at Liberum said. "Glencore's marketing business is down 15 percent -- it's a decent performance for the second quarter." ENERGY TO IMPROVE IN Q3 Operating profit for Glencore's whole trading or marketing division rose 45 percent year-on-year in the first half, but dipped 15 percent in the second quarter against the first, as an improved metals division struggled to make up for weaker earnings in energy products where volatility boosted arbitrage opportunities in the first three months of the year.
