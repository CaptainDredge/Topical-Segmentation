A CSRC spokesman was not immediately available for comment. "The importance of stress tests is rising as Chinese brokerages are conducting more and more innovative businesses such as index futures," said Liang Jing, analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co, adding that he was not aware of the scheme. "Still, China's brokerage industry won't face systemic risks, and even in the event of a prolonged bear market, brokerages' losses won't have far-reaching social impact." During China's 2001-2005 bear market, for example, an industry-wide loss among brokerages did not trigger a series of bankruptcies or social turmoil, partly because they have limited ability to leverage or access the country's under-developed derivatives markets, analysts said.

The planned stress tests by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) come at a time when Beijing is walking a tightrope in taming inflation without hitting the brakes on growth too hard, but some analysts said the move had little to do with current economic difficulties or market sluggishness. Instead, it was part of broader efforts to improve risk management in the financial sector, following similar moves by the banking regulator in the past few years, they said.

However, they emphasized the selection of that scenario did not reflect regulators' expectations of where the market would head. FRAGMENTED SECTOR There are more than 100 brokerages in China's fragmented securities market, and many firms in smaller cities are weak in their financial strength. Revenues at China's 13 listed brokerages, including Citic Securities ( 600030.SS ) and Haitong Securities ( 600837.SS ), fell 6.5 percent in the first half from a year earlier amid cut-throat competition for trading commissions -- their main source of income -- according to the official China Securities Journal.

That has meant the brokerages in the pilot programme have been able to select their own worst-case scenarios, they added. The pilot tests, in which participating brokerages created models for the industry as a whole, concluded that 60 percent of brokerages would make losses under the worst-case scenario -- defined as the CSI300 Index  .CSI300  of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed shares falling below 2,500 points, about one fifth lower than the current level, one source said.

WORST-CASE SCENARIO Under the planned stress tests, brokerages will be asked to gauge, among other things, the impact of a steep fall in the stock market, or a sudden shortage of liquidity in the financial system. They will also be asked to test business, operational and credit risks under extreme circumstances.
