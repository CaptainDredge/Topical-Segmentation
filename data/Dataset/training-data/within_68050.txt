The budget deficit is running near 10 percent of total output, among the highest as a percentage of GDP since World War II. "What makes this so daunting is there is no consensus on what would be a constructive set of actions to pursue," Credit Suisse's Cliggott said. "There's agreement that the patient is not well, but there seems to be a huge disagreement among the consulting physicians about what the right course of treatment might be." One thing Obama may have on his side is the element of surprise.

What's more, the mood in Washington, as elsewhere in the developed world, has turned sharply toward deficit reduction, leaving little appetite for more government spending. Republicans criticized an earlier $800 billion fiscal stimulus program pushed by the White House, saying it had little real impact on the economy. More than two years since the country emerged from recession, some 14 million Americans remain out of work.

That means President Barack Obama will be preaching to a pretty tough crowd on Thursday when he details plans to boost employment. "In many respects, his hands are tied. It takes time to create jobs," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. "And he's not going to have much cooperation from the other side of the aisle." Still, the stakes for the economy and financial markets are high.

"To get the markets excited, a fiscal package would have to include some tax cuts and some infrastructure spending," said Ray Humphrey, senior vice president and senior portfolio manager at Hartford Investment Management Co, with $160.8 billion in assets under management. "But the problem is, even if the spending increases and tax cuts are 'paid for' with some entitlement (reductions), there's no guarantee that this Republican Congress will go along with it because, frankly, by doing what they're doing, it's worked out for them in that the president has become less popular," Humphrey said.

Some traders said a nearly 3 percent rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index  .SPX  on Wednesday and a pullback in gold prices may reflect optimism that Obama will come out swinging. But there's also scope for disappointment. Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said tax cuts would probably have to be big and permanent to stoke a serious stock market rally, "and that won't be easy to do." He recently reduced his year-end S&P 500 forecast to 1,100 from 1,275, saying earnings will contract in 2012 as nominal growth weakens, labor costs edge up and the dollar stabilizes as risk-averse investors bring money back home.
