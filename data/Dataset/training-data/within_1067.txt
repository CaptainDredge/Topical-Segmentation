Germany's RWE ( RWEG.DE ) and Sweden's Vattenfall VATN.UL have been tipped as possible rival suitors. But Exane BNP analyst Jose Javier Ruiz Fernandez said Iberdrola was paying a price broadly in line with recent sector deals and saw little prospect of a counter-offer. "I think it is a good move (by Iberdrola)," he said.

The price includes Scottish Power's 12p special dividend. The value of the long-awaited bid is below the widely expected 800p a share, and at 1140 GMT Scottish Power shares were down 0.5 percent at 743p. Iberdrola was down 2.4 percent at 32 euros, while the DJ Stoxx European utilities index .SX6P was down 0.5 percent.

"They're paying the sector average, it's slightly value creative and it's a new platform of growth, especially in renewables." Ruiz Fernandez said the price Iberdrola was paying put Scottish Power's enterprise value at 12.2 times its forecast earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for 2007, in line with the European utilities sector average of 12.3 and with German group E.ON's EONG.DE recent bid for Spain's Endesa ( ELE.MC ).

Europe's utilities are consolidating as governments ease takeover rules and firms are bolstered by high energy prices and cost cuts. Scottish Power, Britain's fifth-largest energy supplier, has long been viewed as a target for larger rivals. Last year it rejected a 570-pence-a-share offer from E.ON. After buying Scottish Power, Iberdrola will trail only France's EDF ( EDF.PA ) and E.ON among Europe's biggest utilities.

Iberdrola also said the deal would not change its dividend commitments. In the credit derivatives market the cost of insuring Scottish Power's debt against default fell on the prospect of its acquisition by the more creditworthy Iberdrola. Five-year credit default swaps on Scottish Power fell 3 basis points to 21.5 basis points, and those on Iberdrola fell 1.5 basis points to 20 basis points, a trader in London said, meaning it costs 21,500 euros a year to insure 10 million euros of Scottish Power's debt against default.
