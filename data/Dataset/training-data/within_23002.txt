Ads on Google partner sites produced 31 percent of revenue. International revenue rose to 52 percent of revenue from 51 percent in the first quarter and 48 percent in the second quarter of last year. Since its initial public offering in August 2004, Google has regularly reported revenue surprises about 2 percentage points above the average analyst expectation, according to Reuters Estimates data.

"It's hard to love the numbers," said Colin Gillis, analyst at Canaccord Adams. "There's the initial shock of this being the best company in the space and it just fell short." Net income for the second quarter rose to $1.25 billion, or $3.92 per diluted share, from the year-earlier quarter's $925 million, or $2.93 per diluted share.

SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc reported a weaker-than-expected 35 percent rise in quarterly net profit due to lower interest income and higher expenses for foreign currency hedges, driving its shares down 7 percent on Thursday.While other Internet companies have been suffering from a weakening U.S. economy, Wall Street has come to count on Google to deliver positive revenue and earnings surprises over and above consensus expectations each quarter.

Chief Financial Officer George Reyes cited lower yields on cash holdings as it braced for higher interest rates, and the costs of acquiring advertising technology company DoubleClick. Google also spent more to hedge foreign currency exposure, as more than half of its revenue now comes from abroad. "Unless you blow results in this market, investors are going to be very skeptical," said Jeffrey Lindsay, analyst at Sanford C.

Excluding stock-based compensation costs, profit was $4.63 per share, below the $4.72 average of Wall Street analyst forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates. Gross revenue rose 39 percent to $5.37 billion, matching the average of analyst estimates ranging from $5.16 billion to $5.62 billion. Google shares fell as much as 10 percent from a Nasdaq close of $533.44.
