The U.S. economy will likely grow about 3.5 percent this year, he said. Within the Fed, Evans said, some of the most contentious debates center around the outlook for inflation, with some worried about the prospect of prices rising too fast, and others worried about a slowdown in price increases known as disinflation.

CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The U.S. recovery is underway, but inflation is so low and unemployment is so high that the Federal Reserve's super easy monetary policy is still needed, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Wednesday."The recovery is definitely on," Evans said in a rare live appearance on CNBC.

Evans said he himself is concerned about inflation, but only in the long-term. If there is a need to adjust monetary policy in either direction, he said, "I'll be there." The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee next meets in mid-August. Evans defended the U.S. government's giant fiscal stimulus package last year, saying it was effective in turning around both the economy and the psychology.

"We are underrunning our dual mandate," he said, referring to the Fed's twofold goal of maintaining price stability and full employment. "I think the policy accommodation is called for." The Fed cut its target for overnight lending between banks to near zero in December 2008, and on June 23 reiterated its vow to keep rates exceptionally low for "an extended period." Meanwhile Europe's debt woes pose a risk to U.S. growth, and businesses in the U.S. are still are responding to "replacement demand" rather than the "expansionary demand" needed to boost economic growth.

But U.S. housing data has "fallen off a cliff" and jobs gains have slowed markedly, he said. Inflation is underrunning his 2.0 percent guideline for the next three years or more, and the recovery, while not faltering, is slow enough that it will take a number of years before unemployment reaches an acceptable level, he said.
