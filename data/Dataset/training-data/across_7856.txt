He said even after Congress in October approved the $700 billion troubled asset relief program, the U.S. still lacked tools such as an adequate special bankruptcy regime for non-bank financial firms.

The effects of that slowing are likely to last into the first quarter of 2008, Greenspan said. Greenspan suggested that monetary policy-makers may need to give greater weight to the rising costs of energy and food products when looking at inflation. Central bankers in the United States have tended to focus on measures of "core" inflation that exclude food and energy costs in assessing inflation because those prices are widely considered volatile.
