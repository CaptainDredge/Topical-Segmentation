It may give them a little more pricing power."

'READY TO KICK TAIL' To combat rising fuel costs and offset its high wage bill, Southwest plans to start generating revenue from sources other than selling plane tickets. These initiatives, some of which are expected to be rolled out by the end of 2007, could include charging for assigned seats, offering in-flight Internet, and selling hotel rooms through its Web site.

The measures would lead to capacity growth of about 6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and in 2008, down from a planned increase of about 8 percent. The smaller expansion, as well as new business initiatives that Southwest hopes will add more than $1 billion to annual revenue by 2010, should help it meet its target of 15 percent annual earnings growth in the future, though the changes will likely be too late for this year, Kelly said.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ), facing rising costs and tougher competition, plans to trim its expansion through next year because of a slowing U.S. economy and softening travel demand, its chief executive said on Wednesday.Southwest, the leading U.S. discount carrier, intends to adjust its route schedule and reduce its planned fleet expansion by 15 aircraft, CEO Gary Kelly said during a company conference with analysts.

The No. 6 U.S. airline left open the possibility of a further slowdown in growth. "We could find that that growth rate is a little bit too fast," said Kelly. 'BREATHING SPACE' Slower growth could help Southwest reduce capital expenses and lower operating costs, which have been rising as its fuel hedges expire and because the company pays some of the highest wages in the industry.
