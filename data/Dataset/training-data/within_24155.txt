JPMorgan held $16.3 billion of unplaced loans funding buyouts and unfunded commitments for loans as of June 30, the filing said. "Leveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult to hedge effectively, and if market conditions further deteriorate, additional markdowns may be necessary," it said. Lehman Brothers Inc analysts on Tuesday cut their 2008 profit forecast for JPMorgan to $2.30 a share from $2.60, but kept an "overweight" rating and $50 share price target.

The New York-based bank also has substantial exposure to credit cards and other consumer debt that looks increasingly vulnerable as the U.S. economy grows slowly. The Financial Times said JPMorgan was under pressure to write down mortgage assets, in part because of Merrill's decision to sell $30.6 billion of repackaged debt to a private equity fund at 22 cents on the dollar.

JPMorgan's shares fell as the broader financial sector dropped. Lehman Brothers fell 12 percent to $16.21, while Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs all fell more than 6 percent. JPMorgan revealed the losses in a regulatory filing late Monday. The bank said trading conditions have "substantially deteriorated" in the third quarter, and mortgage-backed securities and loans have weakened.

In the filing, JPMorgan said that it expected continued credit deterioration in its consumer portfolio, requiring more reserves for losses, during the rest of 2008. It also said home equity charge-offs could keep rising this year, while prime and subprime mortgage net charge-offs would likely rise "significantly." It said further mortgage deterioration was likely into 2009.

JPMorgan, formed through a series of acquisitions over the last decade, was supposed to have consumer banking and capital markets businesses that complemented each other: when one was doing poorly, the other was supposed to be doing well. "Unfortunately, the first time this concept was tested, it did not work. Both (businesses) seem to be declining in tandem with each other," Bove wrote in a note to clients.
