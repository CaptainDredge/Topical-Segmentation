A fast-growing Hispanic community is no stranger to Bimbo's products in key U.S. cities like Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. The Mexican company plans to invest $1 billion over the next five years in its U.S. operation alone. After the Sara Lee transaction closes in 2011, the United States will become Bimbo's main sales contributor, followed by Mexico and the rest of Latin America.

"Now it is not the immigrants stealing the job but those people buying the corporations." Bimbo shares jumped 4.56 percent on Tuesday to close at 101.90 pesos while Sara Lee added 2.77 percent to $15.21. Still, ratings agency Standard & Poor's put the company on negative credit watch, saying debt would likely increase as a result of the acquisition.

Its name, created by combining the words Bambi and bingo, has entered the Mexican culture and language but still raises eyebrows north of the border -- where the company will now be the No. 1 player in the fresh bread market. The deal, which caps a long list of acquisitions around the world over the past 20 years, is Bimbo's second major U.S. purchase in just two years.

Could there be a backlash over a Mexican business expansion into a United States already divided over Mexican immigrants? "I think it is really interesting. (For many Americans) this purchase is going to signal another way they are losing America," said Nicole Guidotti-Hernandez, a Texas-based scholar who works on U.S.-Mexico relations.

"With a single transaction, Grupo Bimbo further elevates their global baking business and increases both global and U.S. market share," IBISWorld said. Even before the Sara Lee announcement, Bimbo had 100 plants across the world and sold its products in 17 countries, including hard-to-crack China. Bimbo, whose logo is a white, apron-wearing teddy bear that appeals to children, was for decades led by now-reclusive co-founder Lorenzo Servitje, formerly one of Mexico's most prominent businessmen, known for his devout Catholicism.
