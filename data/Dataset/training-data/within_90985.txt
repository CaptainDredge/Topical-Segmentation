Aetna said it will take a $78 million after-tax charge in the current quarter for the settlement, and that the charge will not affect operating earnings. It expects to pay for the settlement over the next one to two years. Patients and doctors accused Aetna of using databases once provided by Ingenix Inc, a unit of UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ), to systematically underpay claims involving services and supplies from out-of-network providers.

The litigation began in July 2007. "We are pleased that we were able to reach a favorable agreement," James Cecchi, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said in a phone interview. The settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler in Newark, New Jersey. Aetna said it expects approval in the middle of 2013, and that it may void the settlement if too many people decide not to participate.

On January 13, 2009, UnitedHealth and Aetna agreed to stop using the Ingenix database and to help fund a new independent database to calculate rates, under agreements with then-New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is now the state's governor. Two days later, UnitedHealth agreed to pay $350 million to settle lawsuits over its out-of-network reimbursements.

The Hartford, Connecticut-based insurer was also challenged over how it calculated out-of-network reimbursement rates, and over its disclosures about those calculations. In a joint court filing on Friday, the plaintiffs and Aetna said the accord was "adequate, fair and reasonable." It would cover patients who used out-of-network providers from March 1, 2001 to the present, and cover out-of-network providers from June 3, 2003 to the present.
