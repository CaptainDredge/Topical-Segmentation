Analysts said the moves, which follow other cost-cutting measures announced in recent weeks, suggest managers are desperately throwing as many levers as possible to bring operations in line with deteriorating fundamentals. Caterpillar's actions, in addition to an across-the-board wage freeze at the Peoria, Illinois-based company, are its broadest moves yet in response to weakening demand for its earth-moving equipment, diesel engines and gas turbines.

"We considered waiting until January to make this announcement," Jim Owens, Caterpillar's CEO, said in a statement, "but decided it was better to communicate these plans with our employees as we approach the completion of our 2009 planning process."

Experts said the takebacks are an ominous sign of things to come at many other U.S. companies as businesses -- even relatively healthy ones like FedEx and Caterpillar -- adopt defensive crouches in response to the worst economic downturn in decades.

"And now all the big sectors that were supposed to hold out, like energy and mining, are softening, too, and projects are either being deferred or postponed at a minimum.

The moves announced Monday come just days after FedEx Corp said it was forcing salaried workers to take at least a 5 percent pay cut and was suspending its 401(k) retirement plan match.

CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Several U.S. manufacturers added their names to the growing list of companies making job or benefit cuts to weather the global financial crisis.Caterpillar Inc, the world's largest maker of heavy construction and mining equipment, said Monday it is cutting white-collar pay by up to 50 percent and offering buyouts to as many as 25,000 U.S. employees as it looks to cut costs during what it characterized as "uncertain times." Textron Inc, the world's largest maker of corporate jets, said it will eliminate 2,200 jobs worldwide to cope with a global downturn that has forced its customers to pare all but essential spending.
