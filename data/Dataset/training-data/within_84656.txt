The SEC said that Wells Fargo's brokerage unit based in Minneapolis agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the charges. It will pay a $6.5 million penalty, plus $65,000 in disgorgement and more than $16,000 in prejudgment interest. The money will go into a fair fund to help harmed investors.

The agency said that "multiple registered representatives" at Wells Fargo, including McMurtry, exercised discretionary authority to purchase asset-backed commercial paper on customers' behalf. The SEC said that McMurtry purchased products tied to mortgage-backed securities for one customer even though the customer had sought to avoid exposure to the housing market and state law also prohibited municipalities from having exposure to high-risk mortgage-backed instruments.

The investors later suffered "substantial losses" after the mortgage-backed complex products defaulted. In selling these risky products to municipalities and non-profits, the SEC said Wells Fargo "relied almost exclusively on the credit-ratings of these products" and did not properly review the private placement documentation to better understand the risks. Credit-rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's have since been blamed by critics for helping to fuel the 2007-2009 financial crisis by giving overly rosy ratings to complex products tied to subprime mortgages that later soured.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will pay more than $6.5 million to settle civil charges alleging it sold complex mortgage-backed instruments to municipalities and non-profits during the financial crisis without fully disclosing the risks.The case marks the latest effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold banks accountable for their actions during the crisis.

In addition to charging the company, the SEC also charged a former Wells Fargo vice president, Shawn Patrick McMurtry, 42, for his role in selling the products. He settled the charges without admitting or denying them. He will pay a $25,000 penalty and will also be suspended from the industry for six months.
