WHERE'S THE GROWTH? Yang may not take the heat alone, given the amount of backing he received from Yahoo's board to press Microsoft for a higher price. But that may mean they all get accused of bad judgment. "I still think it's a fault of the board to let this slip away," said Martin Pyykkonen, analyst at Global Crown Capital.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jerry Yang's got some explaining to do.Come Monday, the Yahoo chief executive will face an angry chorus of shareholders asking why he failed to seal a $47.5 billion deal with Microsoft Corp for the company he helped create. To soften the blow, he will need to show how a last-minute $5 billion sweetener from Microsoft for its unsolicited bid was not enough to overcome the risks of a deal.

"I don't see where you get to justifying a $37 target on the stock on a fundamental basis." Of more concern is the fact that Yahoo has spent three months focused on Microsoft, even as it tries to realign its own business to grapple with a loss of Web search market share and the impact of a weakened U.S. economy on its sales of online display advertising.

But even on Saturday, some shareholders were showing their disbelief. "Wow. I'm shocked Yahoo wasn't more reasonable. The stock will probably go down at least $5 on Monday," said Walter Price, a senior portfolio manager at RCM, which had 21 million Microsoft shares and 2 million Yahoo shares at the end of 2007.

Microsoft ended talks on Saturday after Yahoo dug in for a higher price. Yahoo may also accelerate efforts to find a partner that will help stimulate growth, particularly an alliance with arch-rival Google Inc. "Yang had better be in a situation to shortly come forth with some sort of strategic alternative to explain why $31 a share wasn't enough," said David Garrity, analyst at Dinosaur Research.
