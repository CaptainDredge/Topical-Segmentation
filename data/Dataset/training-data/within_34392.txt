NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG has sweetened its offer for Genentech Inc by about 2 percent to $46.7 billion, a source familiar with the situation said, as Roche pushes to take full control of the biotech after an eight-month courtship.The $95 per share offer on Monday marks the second increase since Friday, when Roche raised its direct tender offer to shareholders to $93 a share and repeated that it was confident of a successful conclusion to the drawn-out takeover battle.

"At $95 you are really hitting that sweet spot where the deal gets done," said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. "From Roche's perspective, a couple of extra dollars to sweeten the bid is probably not that hard to do, and from Genentech shareholders' perspective, a couple of extra dollars is probably all they need to push them over the edge," Conover said.

Roche is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. Genentech, based in South San Francisco, California, declined to comment. "We announced last Friday a very attractive tender offer for $93 per share and it is now up to the shareholders to decide," said Roche spokesman Alexander Klauser, who declined to comment further.

"The new price was enough to get both sides to the table," said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the press. Switzerland-based Roche has been trying since July to acquire the 44 percent of Genentech it does not already own. A deal would mark the latest in a torrid string of acquisitions by large pharmaceutical companies aiming to augment drug development pipelines.

Analysts believe Roche is hoping to complete the Genentech deal ahead of data from a study due in April on Avastin that, if positive, could significantly boost its share price. The Wall Street Journal said an agreement could be announced as early as Monday afternoon, although talks could still break down.
