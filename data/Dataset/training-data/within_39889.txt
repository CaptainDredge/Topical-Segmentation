But I wouldn't want to give an offhand comment on that -- of course, we already have a leverage ratio but the question is whether to raise it or change its format in some way." BERNANKE ON ASSET BUBBLES: Asked whether there was a role for the Fed or other regulators to prevent another real estate bubble from developing, Bernanke said, "I think that could be addressed under the systemic regulation rubrik that we've been discussing with the council, with the Fed overseeing large financial institutions.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from the question and answer session at the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.Bernanke was delivering the central bank's semiannual report on monetary policy and the economy. BERNANKE ON TARP MONEY PROVIDED TO BANKS: "Of the money put in as capital into banks, particularly through the Capital Purchase Program, which is money given out to healthy banks, I would say that virtually all of that money will come back (to the U.S. Treasury).

It is very important that the chairman address -- as he has been doing in a very straightforward way -- these concerns. I am persuaded by the chairman and others that we are able, in an orderly way, to undo what we had to do so that there will not be that inflationary impact."

For troubled firms, like AIG, it depends on how markets evolve and how the firm does going forward." BERNANKE ON ADEQUACY OF LEVERAGE RATIOS FOR FINANCIAL FIRMS: "That's something we should look at. I think there's room here for the regulators -- the Treasury and others and Congress -- to think about our capital regulation plan and see what changes might be made.

But we will be talking about that as we go forward." BERNANKE ON NEED TO GET BUDGET DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL: "Well, I don't think there's much that can be done about this year's deficit and probably not too much about next year's deficit. But the Congress needs to develop a broad plan which encompasses all the spending plans, the taxation plans, that shows a moderation of the deficit over time to something sustainable, which I would guess would be something in the order of two or three percent of GDP." BERNANKE ON WHETHER MORE FISCAL STIMULUS IS NEEDED: "We'll have to see how the economy evolves, so I think it's premature to make any judgments about that." BERNANKE ON CONSUMER SENTIMENT: "The public has been responding to some signs, some glimmers, if you will, of improvement, so consumer sentiment, for example, has improved somewhat as the stock market has gone up and as the outlook has looked better and the jobs situation has at least stopped deteriorating quite as quickly as it was.
