Madoff, a once-respected Wall Street trader and investment adviser, was arrested and charged with securities fraud on December 11 after authorities said he confessed to running a global Ponzi scheme with losses of $50 billion. A Ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid off with the money of new clients.

Miriam Siegman, a 65-year-old retiree from New York, told Reuters she had felt alone since discovering that 40 years of savings had evaporated. "I've felt the need to be around other victims. I'm not sure why," said Siegman, who first invested with Madoff in 1992. "It's comforting in a way." Picard is working with the Securities Investor Protection Corp (SIPC) to liquidate Madoff's brokerage and find assets to distribute to customers who believe they were defrauded.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Going back as far as 13 years, there is no evidence that the firm of accused swindler Bernard Madoff bought securities for customer accounts, the trustee liquidating the firm to recover assets said on Friday.In the first meeting of creditors of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, a lawyer for the court-appointed trustee said his staff was "looking at every Madoff family member and every insider associated with the Madoff firm" as part of the effort to find assets.

All Madoff's assets were frozen and his firm is being liquidated by court order. "The work done to date indicates that for some substantial period, perhaps as much as 13 years ... we have found no evidence that securities were purchased for customer accounts," the trustee, New York lawyer Irving Picard, told the meeting in an auditorium at U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

Picard said his staff was in the process of receiving bids for the market-making part of the firm. The trustee told reporters that the market-making operation and the proprietary trading arm of the firm were legitimate. He said 2,350 customer claims had been filed through Thursday, most of them from individual investors, not the hedge funds that had invested client money with Madoff by the billions and which also consider themselves victims.
