"What I want to get out of the system is taxpayer support for speculative activity," Volcker said. A second hearing is set for Thursday to hear from executives of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Banking committee members are trying to negotiate a bipartisan regulatory reform to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis that caused the worst U.S. recession in decades.

The rethinking may be motivated by possible limits on proprietary trading, the sources said. Volcker -- whose tight-money regime broke the back of inflation when he was Fed chairman in the early 1980s under Presidents Carter and Reagan -- also wants banks to sever ties to hedge funds and private equity ventures.

Volcker, considered a sage of monetary policy and a crusader for tighter regulation, conceded such a move would not have prevented the debacles at AIG and Lehman Brothers at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis. But he said that not adopting new trading limits today would lead to another crisis tomorrow.

Deep divisions remain among committee members over issues such as managing systemic risk, bank supervision and consumer protection. Obama's latest proposals complicated the talks. The House of Representatives approved a bill in December that called for the biggest regulatory changes since the Great Depression, but the "Volcker rule" was not included.

If proprietary trading is not curbed, Volcker told the committee, "I may not live long enough to see the crisis, but my soul is going to come back and haunt you." Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, a Democrat, told the two witnesses he supports the new Obama proposals, but complained they were coming very late to a financial regulation debate that has been going on since 2008.
