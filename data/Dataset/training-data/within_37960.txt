and creating the impression of pensioners being bilked in an Enron- or WorldCom type of way is grossly inaccurate," he said. The cases made by Cuomo and the SEC -- at least so far -- face other hurdles. Aldus was recommended by Memphis-based Consulting Services Group, which asked the SEC to "correct inaccurate allegations" about its pact with Connecticut-based Searle & Co, where Morris was registered as a broker-dealer.

Grand jury proceedings are sealed, which means Cuomo cannot share any information reaped from them with the SEC. But these secrecy rules do not apply to the state securities law, the Martin Act. While the stay stops discovery for the SEC and the defendants, Cuomo could give the SEC what he gleans under the Martin Act, said an attorney for Dallas-based Aldus Equity Partners, which the SEC charged in the pay-to-play probe.

Cuomo's request is common in such investigations, as prosecutors fear that defendants in criminal trials will benefit from any materials turned over to them in civil proceedings. A New York grand jury indicted the former comptroller's fund-raiser, Henry Morris, and pension investment officer, David Loglisci. Lawyers for the two say they are innocent.

That is why so much of the probe focuses on whether the fees were disclosed. The lawyers noted that all investments were vetted by multiple staffers and outside consultants, as required. "The key part is the decision-making process was 100 percent analytically arrived at (according to) policy and procedure," a source familiar with the issues said.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday approved New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's request to delay the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's pension kickback case, rejecting defense attorneys' arguments that this could give the federal regulator an unfair advantage.Cuomo, a Democrat, is investigating millions of dollars of fees investment firms paid to middlemen in return for being hired to invest some of the state's $110 billion pension fund.
