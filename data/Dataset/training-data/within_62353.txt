Revaluation or no revaluation, offshore traders continued to price in heightened expectations of accelerated appreciation over the next several months. One-year dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) were bid at 6.3220 in late trade, down from 6.3400 at Thursday's close. Those levels imply the yuan will appreciate 3.06 percent in a year's time, compared with 2.76 percent implied a day earlier, leaving open a window to bet on more yuan strength in the NDFs. NDFs appeared to be playing catch-up with widespread expectations of 5 to 6 percent yuan appreciation for 2011 after they lagged in forecasting the rise so far this year, partly due to capital outflows from the NDF market into Hong Kong's expanding yuan market.

"There would be huge pressure for the government to explain if it conducted another one-off yuan revaluation of 2 or 3 percent -- a goal it can now easily reach via the market," said a senior trader at a major Chinese state-owned bank in Beijing. "An even larger one-off yuan rise would surely create a huge political storm in a country where quite a large number of people still believe yuan appreciation is part of a Western conspiracy aimed to contain China's development." CONTAINING FALL VERSUS BASKET Still, what has become clear is that Beijing is increasingly ready to let the yuan strengthen against the dollar as a way to help contain the rising cost of imports, which was one reason why the country racked up a rare trade deficit in the first quarter.

SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - The yuan ended at a fresh record high on Friday as the central bank continued to allow the currency to rise to help fight imported inflation, but onshore traders remained convinced it would not resort to any one-off revaluation despite rumors overseas.The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set repeated record highs for the yuan's daily mid-point over the last several weeks, engineering an accelerated rise against the dollar that means it has now gained nearly 5 percent since it was depegged last June.

Even though the yuan has risen by over 1 percent against the dollar so far this year, it has been falling against the currencies of other major trading partners given the dollar's weakness, making imports from places such as Europe more expensive. So in a sense, the PBOC is just limiting the yuan's fall against other currencies, not engineering a rise outright, something traders said showed the government's continuing caution about disrupting exporters and other rate-sensitive sectors.

FASTER, PLEASE Judging by official comments, one might not expect a rise such as that over the last few weeks to continue for long. Guan Tao, an official with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), said in remarks published in China Finance that the yuan should not be allowed to rise sharply, even while Beijing takes steps to rein in the growth in the country's foreign exchange reserves.
