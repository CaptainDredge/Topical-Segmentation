Indeed, core euro zone consumer price inflation (which excludes energy and unprocessed foods) actually retreated to a 13-month low of 1.6 percent in September from 1.7 percent in August and 1.9 percent in July. "Admittedly the overall marked rise in oil prices from their June lows and the prospect of higher food prices due to grain prices being pushed up by poor harvests (notably in the United States) means that euro zone consumer price inflation is likely to be higher than had been hoped for in the near term at least, but underlying price pressures should continue to be limited by generally muted economic activity, excess capacity and ongoing wage moderation amid high and rising unemployment.

ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS FRANCOIS CABAU, BARCLAYS "Eurostat core inflation came with barely any surprise, remaining stable at 1.5 percent, when we were looking for a slight drop and had actually highlighted upside risk to our forecast. "That shows the impact of Spanish VAT hikes in September, so all in all it is not really a great surprise today, but although the headline rate is quite high at 2.6 percent, one has to notice that the core inflation rate is at 1.5 percent and our sense for the remainder of the year is for a downward trend, both in the headline and the core inflation rate.

"Although consumers' inflation price expectations have moved back up recently, this is unlikely to result in higher wages due to the substantial slack in most labor markets. And the latest European Commission survey indicated that companies' pricing intentions remain muted compared to long-term norms, despite rising in September. "With the underlying inflation situation in the euro zone still looking far from alarming and with the euro zone almost certainly having suffered further GDP contraction in the third quarter and still facing a troubling outlook, we maintain the view that it is a question of when - rather than if - the ECB will take interest rates down from 0.75 percent to 0.50 percent.

"We have penciled an interest rate cut to 0.50 percent in December on the assumption that continuing weak economic data and surveys will gradually convince the ECB that lower interest rates are warranted. However, the ECB could delay trimming interest rates until early 2013 due to concerns that the impact of a near-term cut could be diluted by the problems in monetary policy transmission channels." MARTIN VAN VLIET, ING "Euro zone inflation held steady at 2.6 percent in September according to Eurostat, coming in slightly below the consensus and the earlier 'flash' estimate.

-----

"Looking ahead, euro zone inflation should start to move lower before long as previous sharp increases in energy and food prices cease to boost the annual rate. But with commodity prices remaining high and volatile, and further VAT hikes in the pipeline (e.g. in the Netherlands next month and in Finland in January), it is probably going to be a very gradual descent.
