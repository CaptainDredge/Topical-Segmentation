Peabody in a statement said it lived up to its obligations when it spun off Patriot. "This is a matter between the union and Patriot Coal," the company said. On Monday afternoon, arguments were expected to turn to the substance of Patriot's proposed cuts, and whether they are necessary for the company's survival.

Patriot has offered to cease pension contributions and convert healthcare to a VEBA funded by $15 million in up-front cash and $300 million in profit-sharing contributions. The union would receive a 35 percent equity stake in post-bankruptcy Patriot, which it could sell to help fund the VEBA. Under bankruptcy law, if companies cannot negotiate compromises with unions, they can seek court permission to impose cuts unilaterally.

The union on Monday rallied in St. Louis, home to Peabody, where 16 protesters were arrested, the union said in a statement. Conflicting reports left the scope of the rally unclear. The union said the rally attracted about 6,000 people, most of them mine workers. That's more than the 4,000 or so protesters the union was expecting, union spokesman Phil Smith said.

Inside the courtroom, about half of the 60 seats were occupied by miners and their families, many wearing t-Shirts saying "Peabody promised, Patriot lied." Because employees' claims in bankruptcy are subordinate to secured debt like loans and bonds, worker benefits are often the first place bankrupt companies look for cost savings.

In an afternoon session, Patriot was expected to begin arguments supporting its proposal to cease pension contributions and convert healthcare funding to a voluntary employees' beneficiary association, or VEBA. Patriot filed for bankruptcy in July 2012, and has said it must cut $150 million in annual employee obligations to regain profitability.
