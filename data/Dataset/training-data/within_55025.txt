In addition, the Times reported, Michaels and his management team rewrote the employee handbook not long after joining Tribune. "Working at Tribune means accepting that you might hear a word that you, personally, might not use," the new handbook read. "You might experience an attitude you don't share. You might hear a joke that you don't consider funny.

LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Randy Michaels, chief executive of Los Angeles Times owner Tribune Co., circulated an internal memo Tuesday night shooting down a New York Times report accusing him of shocking sexual behavior and creating a "frat house" workplace with "pervasive sex talk."The Los Angeles Times staff received the memo the day before the report ran in print Wednesday.

She also recounted an incident at a meeting where a female executive offered to bring in her assistant to perform a sexual act on someone who appeared to be in a bad mood. The Times also claims that Michaels has a history of complaints lodged against him, including three sexual harassment suits filed during and just after his tenure as head of Clear Channel Communications.

The New York Times piece also says that a future at the Tribune Co. -- which filed for bankruptcy nearly two years ago -- is bleak. In the memo, Michaels writes that the NYT report brings up events and rumors "more than two years old." The NYT article claims that management, installed after Tribune Co. was sold to Sam Zell in early 2008, created a work culture that consisted of "sexual innuendo, poisonous workplace banter and profane invective," adding that the office "came to resemble a frat house, complete with poker parties, jukeboxes and pervasive sex talk." Among the allegations are that Michaels offered a waitress $100 to show him her breasts while dining with colleagues and had a loud conversation in a work area with Tribune Interactive's Marc Chase "about the sexual suitability of various employees." "The conversation just wafted down on all of the people who were sitting there," the Times source said.

"I am tremendously proud of the results of that creative culture." Michaels also wrote that the "rumors" referenced in the story were "spread by an ex-Chicago Tribune employee who is now a contributing writer to the New York Times" and that David Carr, who wrote the story, "has made clear that he is digging up these old allegations because he believes that decisions about the company's management are about to be made, and he wants to influence those decisions." The NYT piece also recounts the events that led to the company's bankruptcy filing in December 2008.
