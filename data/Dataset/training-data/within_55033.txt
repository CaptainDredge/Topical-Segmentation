Stiglitz said there were too many "correlated trades" among large and small firms during the credit bubble, which eventually caused large disruptions and consequently shifted to the public. Soros injected some of his personal experience. "I've been in the business of risk-taking, but I'd never risk more than my capital in any one direction," he said.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor George Soros said on Thursday that the U.S. financial regulation bill does not address the problem of a banking system that is "too connected to fail"."We didn't grasp the real problems" in the financial regulation bill, Soros said at a Financial Times conference. Soros argued that the banking system is too compartmentalized and added he doesn't see what has been done to solve that issue.

Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who joined Soros on the panel about financial regulation, said large and even small financial institutions should share the blame in helping to cause the credit crisis. "When you have a widespread misunderstanding of risk you have good opportunities to exploit that misunderstanding, and that is one reason we have regulation," said Stiglitz, the former World Bank chief economist.

"One thing you have to recognize is that markets are inherently unstable, and maintaining stability has to be the objective of financial authorities," Soros said. "I think things have really gotten out of control and they have not been brought under control by what we've done so far." Soros said during the credit crisis a consumer protection agency should have been in existence to prevent banks from abusing their power in areas such as credit card lending.
