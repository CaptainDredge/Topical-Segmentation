ATLANTA  (Reuters) - The global credit crisis will chill U.S. economic growth well into next year but powerful steps to unlock financial markets have been taken and will work, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday."We at the Atlanta Fed expect weakness to persist for some time into 2009 as credit markets gradually improve," Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart told the Buckhead Rotary Club.

"Nevertheless, given high inflation readings during the summer and into the fall, I'll continue to watch developments closely," he said. U.S. headline consumer inflation peaked at a year-on-year rate of 5.6 percent in July and has since drifted back to a reading of 4.9 percent last month. However, Lockhart did not worry that massive liquidity injections by the central bank risked sparking price pressures by boosting the money supply.

One potential obstacle to further rate cuts appears to be fading. Economists expect the U.S. inflation rate to fall sharply next year as prices for oil and other commodities continue to tumble due to fears about a global recession. Lockhart noted price pressures were heading down. "With the deterioration in economic conditions and the recent associated falloff in energy and many other commodity prices, I anticipate further dissipation of inflationary pressures.

Lockhart also pinned part of the blame for the crisis on the huge leverage that financial firms had been able to create through the use of derivatives, and said that regulation of the credit default swap market was firmly on the Fed's agenda. "We at the Fed very much support the notion of moving to a central clearing house and a more standardized organization of the market," he said.

Traders have priced in a cut in the Fed's benchmark overnight funds rate by at least 25 basis points by the time of its next scheduled policy meeting, on October 28-29. Prices for interest rate futures indicate a roughly 50 percent likelihood that the Fed will cut by a half point.
