In a draft of rules expected to be released late on Friday, the board will also propose governments put pension liabilities up front on their financial statements, instead of tucked into the footnotes of the documents. "It will create the appearance that the government is in a weaker financial position. I say appearance because the reality is that nothing has changed except the display," said the board's chairman, Robert Attmore.

The board wants to create a single system to "reduce complexity and improve comparability," Attmore said. "People will question the cost-benefit of providing this extra information," Attmore also said. "We've heard from many users that this information is essential to understanding the liability." Two pension groups -- the National Association of State Retirement Administrators and the National Council on Teacher Retirement -- have already raised questions about putting the liability on financial statements.

The board will also propose public pensions abandon spreading expenses over several years. That will push losses and changes into a shorter timeframe for many pensions, making them appear greater than when "smoothed." The systems will also have to explain how they have derived expected rates of return and what else is influencing the sizes of their liabilities, such as a recession or a policy change.

It "is equivalent to an individual needing to report on a finance statement, not his or her monthly mortgage payment, but the entire outstanding home mortgage, including interest, so that the debt-to-asset ratio is drastically changed," they said in a statement issued on Thursday. Future pension shortfalls are currently forecast at anywhere from just over $600 billion to $3 trillion, depending on the projected rates of return.

Those advocating for lower return rates say pension funds will never see the investment gains they made before the financial crisis. The other side says pension funds make long-term investments and, given that timeline, it is more rational to follow long-term historical rates.
