WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers newly applying for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and regional manufacturing slipped in January, hinting at some slowing in the pace of economic recovery.The Labor Department said on Thursday initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 36,000 to 482,000 last week as a backlog of applications from the holidays was processed.

PREVIOUS CLAIMS UNDERSTATED "That implies claims in previous weeks were understated so the reduction in new jobless claims between December and January is not as extreme as had been thought," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. "But with lay-offs diminishing, the labor market is still gradually healing." The claims data covered the survey week for the Labor Department's closely watched payrolls report for January, due on February 5.

The biggest problem is companies remain reluctant to expand their capacities, which is weighing on the labor market," said Harm Bandholz, an economist at Unicredit Research in New York. Analysts believe the U.S. economy grew at an annual pace of between 4 and 5 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 2.2 percent rate seen in the July-September period.

The index, which measures factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region, hit a 4-1/2-year high of 22.5 in December. Markets had expected the index to come in at 18.0. A reading above zero indicates growth in the region's manufacturing. The survey's employment index hit its highest since February 2008. "The data still point to growth in activity this month, and we don't see any need to significantly alter our view that the factory sector is shifting from being on the mend to steady expansion," said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.

Bolstering views the recovery remains intact, the Conference Board, a business research group, said its index of leading economic indicators rose 1.1 percent to an all-time high of 106.4 last month. Although the Labor Department report also showed the four-week moving average of new jobless claims, a measure of underlying trends, snapped a 19-week trend of declines last week, it remains below the 450,000 level that analysts say indicates stability in the labor market.
