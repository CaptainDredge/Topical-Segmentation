GMAC FINANCING FOR CHRYSLER DEALERS U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzalez on Tuesday approved Chrysler's request that GMAC LLC be allowed to provide financing for Chrysler dealers, a decision enabling them to boost vehicle inventories if needed. More than 60 percent of Chrysler's 3,200 dealers had been getting financing through Chrysler Financial, which halted its lending almost entirely after Chrysler filed for bankruptcy.

DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp shares hit there lowest level since the Great Depression on Tuesday and Nissan Motor Co posted a loss and expected more amid the deep global auto downturn.GM, less than three weeks from a June 1 deadline to reach agreements with its stakeholders that could avert a bankruptcy filing, saw its shares fall to their lowest level since 1933 a day after current and former executives reported stock sales.

All told, Chrysler hopes to have completed the bulk of its bankruptcy process within 60 days of the filing. The sale would bring an end to Chrysler's ownership by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, which acquired an 80.1 percent stake from Daimler AG in August 2007. Chrysler has been offering buyouts to all of its UAW workers in the United States and plans plant closings under its restructuring with new special buyouts that must be completed by May 26 for the plan to remain on track, according to a union memo obtained by Reuters.

The automaker's stockholders would be left with one percent of the company under an out-of-court restructuring plan or could be wiped out if GM is forced into bankruptcy leaving the equity essentially worthless either way. Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement told reporters that he would meet with top U.S. officials next week in Washington to assess GM's progress on restructuring.
