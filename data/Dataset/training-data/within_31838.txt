The yen should hold firm below 100 to the dollar for most of 2009 as investors remain defensive in the midst of the global financial crisis, although it may weaken in the second half, a Reuters analysts' poll showed last week. In the past year, the daily correlation between the dollar/yen exchange rate and the Nikkei is a positive 82 percent -- meaning the Nikkei almost always falls when the yen pushes higher.

In the business year ending in March 2010, the price-to-earnings ratio of the top 500 Japanese companies is seen at 12.25 times compared with 14.13 for the current year, according to Thomson Reuters data. That is still higher than the 10.88 forward P/E ratio for S&P 500 companies this year, and the single-digit levels some analysts see in European indexes such as Germany's DAX The yen's record surge last year has added to the pain from the global economic downturn for top Japanese exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp, which called the current climate an unprecedented emergency in its 70-year history.

The drop to 0.87 was the lowest since 1991, according to figures from Thomson Reuters. Even during Japan's decade of economic stagnation, deflation and banking crisis, the price-to-book ratio never fell below 1. But analysts don't think buyers will be swayed just yet. "Unless investors can confirm the economy and corporate earnings will likely soon hit the bottom, buying based on those valuations won't take place," said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities.

"Demand is dropping fiercely for companies," said Takashi Ito, a senior strategist at Nomura Securities. But based on analysts' earnings expectations, Japanese shares are still more expensive than the United States and Europe despite having suffered a bigger slide than those markets. A corporate culture where firms hold shares in each other is one reason why valuations have been historically higher in Japan than other regions.

Miura sees the Nikkei between 6,000 and 10,000 points until March 2010, but said it may rally after that because the market tends to find a floor on average 33 months after reaching a peak. The index is now around 8,400. The Nikkei's tight linkages to the yen also mean a stock recovery is almost impossible without a weaker Japanese currency.
