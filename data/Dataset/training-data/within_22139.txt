"I believe that inflation is a problem that can be controlled in the euro zone," Knight told a news conference, but added it was hard to tell whether an expected quarter-point ECB hike to 4.25 percent on Thursday would be enough. Central bankers from emerging economies showed little appetite for one of the BIS's main calls: a revaluation of their currency rates, especially those pegged to a weakening dollar.

"Their interaction does appear to point to a deeper and more protracted global downturn than the consensus view seems to expect. At the same time, inflationary forces, particularly in emerging market economies, could also prove unexpectedly strong and persistent." The BIS was most pessimistic about the U.S. economy, saying that as well as the housing downturn there was a danger that consumption would take a further hit from people trying to rebuild savings depleted by past over-borrowing.

Sultan Nasser al-Suweidi, the United Arab Emirates' central bank chief, told Reuters the Gulf state was sticking firmly to its dollar peg, and the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, said the Chinese dependency would not widen the trading band for the Hong Kong dollar.

BIS General Manager Malcolm Knight said central banks faced their greatest challenge in years, as inflation argued for interest rate hikes that could further dampen economic growth. "Clearly, the downside risks for future growth complicate the task of monetary policy," he said in a speech to the BIS annual meeting. "But there must in the end be a forceful response to confront the danger that inflation expectations could rise appreciably, with all the attendant problems that would bring." The tone of the annual report was darker than last year after what the BIS described as the worst financial market turmoil since World War Two, and the bank saw a "significant risk" of recession in the United States, the world's biggest economy.

This did not mean central banks should abandon their focus on fighting inflation with rate hikes. "With inflation a clear and present threat, and with real policy rates in most countries low by historical standards, a global bias towards monetary tightening would seem appropriate," the BIS said. But it added: "That said, the circumstances of different countries, both actual and prospective, currently rule out a 'one-size-fits-all' approach.
