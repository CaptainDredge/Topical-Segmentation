Growth of volumes were strong and the average selling price (ASP) was pretty good and Devices unit's profitability was good." GEOFF BLABER, CCS INSIGHT "Nokia will be relieved to have turned a corner and returned to healthy year-on-year volume and margin growth. But despite the improvement in smartphone performance, Nokia's high tier portfolio remains a critical focus point for 1H10." "Nokia's smartphone performance saw a reassuring improvement despite a strong quarter for RIM and Apple.

We are therefore confident Nokia can deliver our current expectations for 2010." OLIVER FINGER, DZ BANK "Quite solid Q4 figures, given the previous expectations and the tough market environment."

HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The world's top cellphone maker Nokia reported on Thursday forecast-beating fourth quarter results.Following are analysts' comments. THOMAS LANGER, WEST LB "These are really mind-blowing results, especially in the ASP (average selling price) reversal in Devices, and the decent-to-good operating margin."

"However, I think there is definitely a risk one gets over excited -- the challenges in the smartphone markets will become obvious to everybody, and we think the competition will intensify throughout the year." PIERRE FERRAGU, BERNSTEIN "Nokia has a stabilized pricing power and will fully benefit from the rebound in handsets in 2010 and from the "democratization trend" of smartphones." "As never before Nokia guided for a first quarter of 2010 in devices and services making our current expectation the low end of their guidance.
