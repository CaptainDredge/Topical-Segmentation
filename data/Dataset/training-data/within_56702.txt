"We're in an impossible situation here. We're being asked to tacitly support a budget that we haven't seen," Fine Gael lawmaker Brian Hayes told public broadcaster RTE. EU partners are watching the Irish turmoil with concern. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told employers that Ireland's crisis was different from Greece's but just as worrying and the euro was in an "exceptionally serious situation." Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said it would be a bad idea to throw Ireland out of the euro or split the single currency area with southern countries devaluing, since that would provoke "a chain of unwanted events." But he told RTL 7 television: "Shareholders and holders of subordinated bonds in Irish banks will have to bleed in a restructuring." Greece, the first country to be bailed out by the euro zone and the IMF earlier this year, won a vote of confidence from EU and IMF inspectors on Tuesday after promising extra measures to shore up its ailing finances.

AUSTERITY PLAN The Irish government is expected to announce it will cut the minimum wage, social welfare spending and the number of public employees and add a new property tax and higher income taxes in a package intended to shave 6 billion euros off next year's budget, and 15 billion off the annual budget by 2014.

European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters after meeting Irish members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France: "Stability is important. "We don't have a position on the domestic democratic politics of Ireland but it is essential that the budget will be adopted in time and we will be able to conclude the negotiations on the EU-IMF program in time." In New York, senior IMF official John Lipsky said talks with Ireland were moving forward quickly but it was up to the Irish government to make the necessary political decisions.

STRASBOURG/DUBLIN  (Reuters) - The European Union urged Ireland on Tuesday to adopt an austerity budget on time to unlock promised EU/IMF funding, in response to a deepening political crisis that could derail the financial rescue.Dublin's government is on a knife-edge. Damaged Prime Minister Brian Cowen has rebuffed calls for a snap election and insisted the budget would go ahead as planned on December 7 before he calls an early poll.

Opposition leader Enda Kenny hinted in parliament that his center-right Fine Gael party might let the budget pass, saying it would act in the national interest, and challenged Cowen to bring it forward to next week, but the prime minister refused. Cowen said he expected all budget legislation to be completed by February, suggesting he would not call an election in January as his coalition partners had requested.
