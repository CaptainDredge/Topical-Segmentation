(Reuters) - Powerful Hurricane Ike bore down on the heart of the U.S. energy sector in Texas on Friday, leaving most U.S. Gulf of Mexico production idled and threatening a fifth of U.S. refining capacity with howling winds and a possible 20-foot wall of water.Forecasters said the storm, packing winds of more than 100 mph, would likely hit near Houston early Saturday, after oil companies shut down about 25 percent of the nation's crude oil production and nearly 22 percent of its refined fuel production as a precaution.
