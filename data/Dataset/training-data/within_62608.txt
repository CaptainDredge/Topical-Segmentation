WHICH PRODUCTS ARE SWAPS? * Interest-rate swaps, commodity swaps, currency swaps, equity swaps, credit-default swaps, non-exchange traded foreign currency options, commodity options, non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards, cross-currency swaps, forward rate agreements, contracts for differences, and options to enter into swaps and forward swaps * A total return swap on a single loan or narrow-based security index (defined as fewer than 9 securities) is a security-based swap.

It also will divide jurisdiction between the agencies, with "security-based swaps" coming under SEC oversight. Here are some details of what was proposed: WHICH PRODUCTS ARE NOT SWAPS? 1) Insurance In order to qualify as insurance, a contract must contain certain characteristics: * The beneficiary of the contract must have an insurable interest * There must be proof of a loss and payment for that loss should be limited to the value of what was insured * It cannot be traded over-the-counter * The contract must be sold by a company whose primary business is insurance and is regulated as insurance * Product types protected include surety bonds, life insurance, health insurance, long-term care insurance, title insurance, property and casualty insurance and annuity products subject to certain tax treatment 2) Consumer products, loans and mortgages: * Any agreement used for personal or household purposes such as leasing, mortgage lending, intellectual property rights, loans with variable or capped interest rates * Products covering commercial transactions would include employment contracts and benefit arrangements, servicing or distribution arrangements, the purchase or sale of real property, mortgage purchasing agreements, variable or fixed rate loans and warehouse lending agreements * Examples could include contracts to purchase inventory for a business, or heating oil for a home 3) Nonfinancial forwards: * Covers transactions where a seller agrees to provide a specific commodity at some point in the future 4) Loan participations: * These contracts, used by original lenders on a transaction to provide economic exposure to a loan to parties that were not the original lenders, are not swaps.

If it contains certain provisions in the contract, like interest-rate optionality, it will be a mixed swap. WHICH PRODUCTS STILL REMAIN AMBIGUOUS? 1) Foreign currency swaps and forwards: * These will be treated as swaps unless the U.S. Treasury Secretary decides to exempt them from most of the regulations. No decision has been announced * Even if they are exempted from clearing rules, they still must be reported to a data repository and dealers will be held to business conduct rules * The CFTC is proposing a rule that would grant it "anti-evasion" authority to go after anyone who intentionally structures covered products as forex swaps to avoid regulations 2) Financial transmission rights: * These contracts used to manage congestion on the grid in regional transmission markets will not be addressed in the joint rule-making.
