NEW YORK  (Reuters) - All three major U.S. stock indexes plunged more than 2 percent on Tuesday after a record loss at Citigroup Inc and the worst showing for retailers in five years fueled fears that the economy was heading into a recession.Citigroup ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, slashed its dividend after writing down $18.1 billion for losses tied to subprime home loans and other risky debt, sending its shares down 7 percent.

The latest retailer with disappointing news was home goods store Williams-Sonoma, which cut its outlook on Tuesday after a weak holiday sales season. Williams-Sonoma ( WSM.N ) shares slid 9.9 percent at $20.01. Retail sales figures are considered a key benchmark because consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
