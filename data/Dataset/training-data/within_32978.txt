The White House itself has been vague about what it wants other than a plan with enough support by Democrats and Republicans to win passage and create jobs. Appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation," Christina Romer, another top Obama fiscal adviser, said, "If we can get this (rescue) package through, we can turn it (the economy) around and be back on the road to growth." FAILURE WILL BE "CATASTROPHIC" Warning that failure is not an option, Romer said if the package falls apart, "I think it would be -- the word the president used was catastrophic." Seeking to keep Congress focused on the package, the Obama administration on Sunday put off Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's announcement of a keenly awaited and separate bank rescue plan that had been expected to be made on Monday.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Top aides to President Barack Obama on Sunday urged Democratic and Republican lawmakers to set aside political differences and quickly approve a massive economic stimulus package this week."If there was ever a moment to transcend politics, this is that moment," Larry Summers, head of the White House National Economic Council, told "Fox News Sunday." Yet, with the world watching to see how the new president and Congress respond to the worst U.S. financial crisis in 70 years, more political fireworks were certain at the U.S. Capitol.

The president takes his case to the public this week, traveling on Monday to Indiana for a town hall meeting and then returning to the White House for a prime-time news conference. Tuesday he goes to Florida for another town hall. The political drama is being played out as the Democratic and Republican parties are at odds ideologically, with both claiming popular support.

Republicans stand accused of having driven the country into an economic mess under President George W. Bush, and of pushing a tax-cut agenda that failed to revive the economy and instead helped create a record federal deficit. Foes accuse Obama's Democrats of seizing on the economic crisis to pump cash into their pet projects and "big government" social agenda under the guise of creating jobs.

"I think most of them have made a political calculation that it's better to be in opposition. And you can see that on a political basis because, look, this economy is in desperately serious shape," Conrad said. Republican Senator John Ensign said he expected the Senate bill to pass. But Ensign said he and other Republicans want time to go through the compromise package that was reached on late Friday and put into written legislation late on Saturday.
