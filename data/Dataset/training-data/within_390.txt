Chrysler did not rule out cooperation but said no decisions had been made. Honda would only acknowledge receipt of the letter, while Toyota would not, and Nissan did not comment, the paper added. Tom Sidlik, vice president of global procurement and supply for DaimlerChrysler, told Reuters in August he would "look at" steel futures contracts as a hedging tool should they become available but he was not convinced how attractive they would be.

"I would like to propose that we coordinate our future efforts in order to accelerate this process and to lay the groundwork to ensure that the steel contract is successful," the paper cited a letter that Brown sent to other carmakers in North America on October 2 as saying. "A financial hedging mechanism is a solution that will benefit us all." Ford could not be immediately reached for comment.

FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) has lobbied other carmakers to support the introduction of steel futures contracts as a way to help hedge their exposure to volatile prices for the crucial metal, an industry paper reported.But the response to the initiative, launched last month by Ford purchasing chief Tony Brown, had only been lukewarm, Automotive News said in its Monday edition.

The letter went to North American counterparts at General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE, Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) and Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ), the paper said. GM purchasing head Bo Andersson informed Brown that the world's biggest carmaker would not participate in the effort, the paper quoted a GM spokeswoman as saying.
