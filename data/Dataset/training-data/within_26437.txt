The four-week average of new jobless claims, a better gauge of underlying labor trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose to 474,000 to 462,500 the week before. That was also the highest reading in seven years, or since October 27, 2001, when it was 480,750, the department said. The measure has mounted steadily as the U.S. housing slump and resulting strain in the financial services industry has chilled growth and crimped hiring.

"It is estimated that the effects of Hurricane Gustav in Louisiana and the effects of Hurricane Ike in Texas added approximately 45,000 claims to the total," the Labor Department said in its weekly report.

The number of people remaining on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid increased 48,000 to 3.591 million, the highest since the week ended September 6 2003. Analysts had estimated so-called continued claims to be 3.55 million. It was the 23rd straight week that claims were above 3 million, in another sign that the slowing economy is making it harder for U.S. workers to find jobs.

Economists said the report showed the economy was being rattled by forces other than the hurricanes, adding that the numbers were at high levels even when the impact of the storms was filtered out . "The underlying claims reflect an upward trend in unemployment," said Dana Saporta, economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Securities LLC in New York.
