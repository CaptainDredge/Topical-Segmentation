(Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) will produce the next generation of Chevrolet Camaro in Lansing, Michigan, not at the plant in Oshawa, Ontario, where it currently assembles the sports car, the company said on Wednesday.While the move is a fresh setback for workers at GM's Oshawa operation, where employment has dwindled over the last decade, it's a win for Michigan's hard-hit auto sector.

"Frustrated is an understatement," said National President Ken Lewenza. "We are outraged by this decision." The current generation Camaro will remain at Oshawa's "flex" line, which is still set to gain a third shift as GM works towards a 2013 launch for the new Chevrolet Impala. The latest contract for GM Canada workers came with the promise of new shifts and an extended life for the "consolidated" assembly line in Oshawa to 2014.

When the deal was announced, union leaders said they expected that no one with seniority would be on layoff at GM by the end of the contract. Separately on Wednesday, GM said it would buy back 200 million of its shares from the U.S. Treasury, and the U.S. government plans to sell its remaining stake within 15 months.

GM has not said when it will launch the new Camaro, but an industry source familiar with the company's plans said the current model is expected to remain in production in Oshawa through 2015. The next-generation Camaro, due in early 2016, is expected to share its underpinnings with the Cadillac ATS, so the same line in Lansing could assemble both models, the source said.

LABOR COSTS Kristin Dziczek, director of labor and industry at the Center for Automotive Research, said labor costs may also have played a role. In the United States, new hires make a lower wage than their veteran unionized peers. "There's a considerable number of entry-level people and a lot of the older workers have already retired or taken retirement incentives," said Dziczek of GM's U.S. workforce.
