They have a fairly large install base of BlackBerry users globally, so that's one asset. And they have a fairly strong brand name, so they will have to build on that." GEOFF BLABER, ANALYST, CCS INSIGHT, LONDON "History tells us not to write off RIM.

Commentary: COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC PARTNERS, NEW YORK "The company is going into the abyss of a transition and even if they get a new model, it's a new model on the old platform. Unfortunately, they already gave us the roadmap, with QNX being their entry back into the high end of the market, and that's 2012." "So while the new Bold certainly looks nice, it certainly doesn't seem like it's going to be coming any time in the middle of the summer, maybe before the end of the summer, which is the end of September.
