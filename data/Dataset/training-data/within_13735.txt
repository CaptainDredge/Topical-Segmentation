Markets and policy-makers have been caught off guard by how hard and broadly rising defaults on U.S. subprime mortgages have hit. As roughly 1.8 million adjustable rate mortgages line up for reset at sharply higher  interest rates in 2008, the prospect of more pain for homeowners and banks has increased since the Fed last met in October.

While the action was widely expected, some economists had thought the Fed might offer a bolder half-point reduction. In a related move, the Fed trimmed the discount rate it charges for direct loans to banks by a matching quarter point. Here too, some market participants were dissatisfied. Many had thought the Fed would lower the discount rate by more than the federal funds rate to lubricate tight credit markets.

At that meeting, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate target by a quarter point to 4.5 percent, a move that followed a surprisingly large half-point cut in September, and said the risk of a pick-up in inflation was roughly equal to downside risks to economic growth. However, even as hiring has remained steady, consumer spending has softened and a large overhang of unsold homes likely means any recovery in the battered housing market is still some ways off.

"Today's action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, should help promote moderate growth over time," the Fed said. The U.S. central bank acknowledged the economy was slowing, citing in particular the "intensification" of the housing sector's downturn. But it also said it was possible persistently high oil prices could push inflation up.

With home prices sliding and borrowing conditions tightening, many forecasters are warning the economy is skirting close to recession. The No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund said in an interview published on Tuesday that U.S. recession fears were overblown. "Never say never, but the latest indicators do not justify such a conclusion," IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky told an internal IMF publication.
