"There's clearly tremendous appetite for preferred shares, so I don't think raising capital is going to be an issue at all."

While the losses were likely tempered after the two raised their fees and as the credit crunch drove many of their rivals to the sidelines, they are still expected to need to raise significant additional capital.

"Freddie Mac is well positioned to meet the challenges of the unsettled market." PROFITS AHEAD?

That's why we're tightening our credit box, using risk-based pricing, etc," Patti Cook, Freddie Mac's chief business officer, said in prepared remarks for a mortgage bankers event in Boston on Monday.
