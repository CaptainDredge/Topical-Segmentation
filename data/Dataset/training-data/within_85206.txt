IMPLOSION RISK "The question is really who has the power to keep the investment bank from imploding," said one former Barclays investment banker, now working at a fund but still in touch with ex-colleagues. Former Barclays employees said the bank's purchase of the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed in 2008 had created some rivalries between the Barclays "old guard" and ex-Lehman staff.

The rivalry had been kept in check by Diamond, Del Missier and Rich Ricci, who heads the investment bank, the former Barclays banker said. The fact that Ricci had stayed in July when the others left had averted a bloodbath, he said. "There's been a lot of disarray already and that's going to continue," he added.

But Jenkins' rise to the top underscores how the investment bank has lost the clout it enjoyed internally under former trader Diamond and a reorganization is on the cards that will not please all. Though he declined to outline how the investment bank will look, Jenkins has already said the division needs to adjust to pressures from weak economies and increased regulation.

Some bankers said changes made sense at the investment bank, which employs more than 20,000 of the nearly 140,000 Barclays staff. The former Barclays debt banker said his team would get chewed out every morning for lagging in industry league tables, which measure banks against each other. "We needed to be higher every day, and we'd go off and do whatever we needed to do to get higher," he said.

LONDON  (Reuters) - A promised return to stability for scandal-hit Barclays is the last thing its shamed investment bank can expect from a cultural revolution likely to bring battles over power and pay.New chief executive Antony Jenkins, from the less racy world of credit cards and retail lending, could hardly be further from the Masters of the Universe who were epitomized by his predecessor Bob Diamond and blamed for the breaches that cost him his job.
