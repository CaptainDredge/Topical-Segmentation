A spokeswoman for Murdoch's News International company declined to comment. Other newspapers, to be published on Saturday, claimed that at least one executive at the company may have deleted millions of emails related to police investigations into phone hacking, a charge the spokeswoman said was "rubbish." "We are cooperating actively with police and have not destroyed evidence," she said.

She has denied knowing that journalists on the paper were hacking the voicemails of possibly thousands of people. But she has become the focus of anger among the 200 News of the World staff sacked by Murdoch's son James with little ceremony. There was "seething anger" and "pure hatred" directed toward her, one reporter said: "We think they're closing down a whole newspaper just to protect one woman's job." Fellow journalists saluted the end of a venerable, muckraking title: "Hacked To Death" headlined Murdoch's own Times.

"I thought we had a prime minister today who showed he doesn't get it. He doesn't get it over BSkyB," said Miliband, who wants the bid blocked. "He also doesn't get it on Andy Coulson ...

Alan Rusbridger, editor of the left-leaning Guardian which has campaigned to expose more of the scandal, told Reuters Cameron could be faulted on Coulson: "I just wonder what vetting process was done.

Cameron told reporters he had heard that Brooks offered her resignation. "I would have taken it," he said. BROOKS' "TOXIC" BRAND Journalists putting together the final edition of the 168-year-old title, Britain's biggest-selling Sunday paper, had an emotional, sometimes angry, meeting with Brooks, who told them, according to a staffer who was present, that the News of the World brand had become "toxic." Advertisers and readers baled out following allegations this week of serial phone hacking.

Cameron said he took "full responsibility" for his decision to appoint Coulson, who quit Downing Street in January when police relaunched inquiries. But the premier rebuffed criticism and strove to spread the blame for an affair that has generated public outrage against the press, politicians and police. "Murder victims, terrorist victims, families who have lost loved ones in war..." he said: "That these people could have had their phones hacked into in order to generate stories for a newspaper is simply disgusting." So widespread was the rot, Cameron told an emergency news conference after Murdoch dramatically shut down his best-selling Sunday paper, that only a completely new system of media regulation and a full public inquiry into what went wrong over a decade at News of the World and beyond would meet public demand.
