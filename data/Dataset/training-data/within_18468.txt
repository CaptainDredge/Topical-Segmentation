"Unlike the sponsors, we have consistently negotiated the open items in good faith," a spokesman for the banks said in an e-mailed statement, "and in fact were still doing so when without warning the sponsors took the unproductive step of asking a court to intercede in our discussions only hours after sending us revised terms to review." The court filing from the banks claims that "plaintiffs have presented no basis for litigation, much less proceeding in an expedited manner," according to a copy obtained by Reuters.

While there is much uncertainty surrounding this transaction, it is my expectation that the merger will close," Mays wrote. The dispute is the latest in a string of deals that have descended into litigation, as the credit crunch made financing loans more expensive and banks unwilling to take losses. Clear Channel's shares closed on Monday at $29.22.

The banks were to provide more than $22 billion financing and earn more than $400 million in fees. Despite the public disagreement, the banks said on Monday that they are still willing to reach a funding agreement on "mutually agreeable terms" and there was still time to return to the negotiating table.

The filing says that the banks had repeatedly asked the buyout firms for details on the loan agreement but received scant replies. It also says that they were not advised that the private equity firms would start litigation if an agreement wasn't reached by a certain date. The banks also argued there was no basis for the buyers to seek an expedited trial, claiming that it "defies credulity" for all the depositions necessary to be completed in "little more than twenty-five days." The private equity firms retaliated in an e-mailed statement that the banks' opposition was "more of the same 'run out the clock' strategy they have been pursuing since February." "The claim that they were negotiating in good faith and blindsided by the litigation is preposterous, and clearly contradicted by the correspondence record," they said.
