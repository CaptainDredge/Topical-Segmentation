Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said his agency could not have foreseen Bear's sudden cash crisis. "Up to and including the time of its agreement to be acquired by JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns had a capital cushion well above what is required" of large global banks, he said.

Cox has said, however, that those bank guidelines may need to be tightened. Bernanke said the Fed thought it needed to act immediately on Bear or risk serious damage not only to global financial markets, but also the broader economy. On March 14, the Fed and JPMorgan announced emergency financing. Two days later, JPMorgan agreed to buy Bear for just $2 per share -- well below the $60 where it had traded the previous week.

JPMorgan's Dimon insisted that JPMorgan did not "cherry pick" the best Bear assets. Under its deal with the Fed, JPMorgan will have to incur the first $1 billion in any losses if Bear's assets deteriorate further. Cox said his agency had never contemplated a situation in which a bank -- in this case Bear -- would not be able to obtain loans despite having strong collateral.

The Fed committed $29 billion in taxpayer money to back Bear's assets to facilitate JPMorgan Chase & Co's agreement to buy the stricken investment bank. Bear's chief executive, Alan Schwartz, said without that deal, his firm would have filed for bankruptcy last month. That would have been far more costly to the U.S. economy because it would have led to higher borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to municipal loans, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said.

The offer has since been raised to $10 a share. Treasury Undersecretary Robert Steel echoed Bernanke's comments, noting that the government's focus was "not on this specific institution, but on the more strategic concern of the implications of a bankruptcy. "The failure of a firm that was connected to so many corners of our markets would have caused financial disruptions beyond Wall Street," he said.
