U.S. automakers General Motors Co ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler Group LLC ( FIA.MI ) as well as South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) stand to capture most of the consumers who defect from the Japanese brands, said Dan Cheng, head of A.T. Kearney's American automotive practice.

Of the estimated 1.66 million units of lost production globally because of the Japan crisis, 341,000 would have been sold in the United States this year. Of those lost U.S. sales, 42 percent were buyers who likely will remain loyal to their current brands, said Cheng. Of the remaining 197,000, an estimated 80 percent were with Toyota, Honda and Nissan, A.T. Kearney said.

Another 36,000 are with other Japanese manufacturers. If full production at Japanese plants does not resume until the fourth quarter, the number of new vehicle sales up for grabs will rise to 328,000, or the equivalent of 2-1/2 points of market share, Cheng said. Of those, 263,000 would be with Toyota, Honda and Nissan.
