WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A congressional hearing into the alleged $50 billion Bernard Madoff fraud drew calls from Democratic lawmakers for an overhaul of financial regulation as their confidence ebbs in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."Clearly our regulatory system has failed miserably and we must rebuild it now," said Rep.

"Many of us have lost confidence in the SEC," said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York. "Where can we go to get the proper oversight? I don't have trust in them (the SEC) for the future," she said. Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, said the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a broker watchdog, should have been enforcing the securities laws in this case.

The newspaper also reported that Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC was examined at least eight times in 16 years by the SEC and other regulators, who often had suspicions. But it said officials never uncovered the alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme that investigators now believe began in the 1970s. U.S. prosecutors asked a judge on Monday to revoke the bail terms for Madoff, claiming he was a flight risk.

Paul Kanjorski. The Pennsylvania Democrat chaired a committee hearing Monday on the scandal involving one-time Wall Street powerbroker Madoff, who stands accused of running a massive fraud that touched investors and charities around the world. Witnesses at the hearing included SEC Inspector General David Kotz, who pledged a thorough inquiry of the agency's handling of the case.

The Madoff affair "fell through the cracks of our regulatory system," Kanjorski said. "It now appears that regulators should have detected the Madoff wrongdoing earlier because of the red flags raised by others." The scandal should be the "final prod" for reform of the financial regulatory structure, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Monday.
