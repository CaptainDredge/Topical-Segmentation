NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Earnings season is heating up, but investors' feet are getting cold.Central bank-fueled gains took markets within reach of five-year highs in September, but now U.S. stock market participants are shifting their focus back to corporate outlooks, and the picture is not pretty. Early earnings reports have underlined those concerns, which may be exacerbated when dozens of major companies - including Dow components General Electric ( GE.N ), Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) - report next week.

Profits are being dragged down by material .GSPE and energy .GSPE stocks. Material sector earnings are seen dropping 24 percent, and energy sector results are expected to slide 19 percent. In contrast, aggregate profit growth for financials .GSPF is seen up 1.6 percent.

"Citigroup is the one we're looking for. If profits come in worse than expected there, that would make me more bearish about the economy in general." FEWER COMPANIES BEAT THE STREET With only 6 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, 59 percent of companies have topped profit expectations - less than the average beat rate of 67 percent for the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"Caution is definitely the operative word as Europe and China look to continue dragging on earnings," said Michael Loewengart, director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial in New York. "The overall tone is so pessimistic that we may see some upside surprises, but we could still suffer considerable losses if the news is bad." Profits of S&P 500  .SPX  companies are seen dropping 3 percent this quarter from a year ago, the first decline in three years, hurt by China's slowing growth and Europe's debt crisis, which recently prompted the International Monetary Fund to cut its 2012 economic growth outlook.

"Tech results can be a good proxy for business spending, which will give us a sense of how companies are viewing the future," said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. Carey, who helps oversee about $200 billion in assets, said outlooks were still too optimistic, "so I've pulled in my horns a bit, and have become more defensive." BLUE CHIPS, GREECE AND DATA McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), UnitedHealth Group ( UNH.N ) and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) are also scheduled to report earnings, along with General Electric, which E-Trade's Loewengart said would be particularly watched, given the company's diversified operations.
