The new debt includes about $8 billion in secured revolving credit that replaces an existing unsecured credit line of $6.3 billion, and a secured loan of about $7 billion, the company said. This is the first time Ford has used collateral for loans, Ford spokeswoman Becky Sanch said. "They're at the point where they have to pledge assets for loans," said Glenn Reynolds, chief executive officer of New York-based research firm CreditSights Inc., who said it was an indication investors view Ford as a "very high-risk" company.

Ford is offering buyouts to all of its 75,000 unionized workers in the United States to reduce its factory staff by nearly half. The bulk of hourly workers are taking buyouts to leave the company in the first and second quarter of 2007. Ford has said the restructuring would reduce its cash to near $20 billion by the end of the year and said it expected its cash flow to remain negative in the coming few years.

"This confirms they see nothing but trouble ahead because they're front-loading their debt now," Reynolds said. The borrowing, which also includes $3 billion in unsecured notes that can be converted into Ford common stock, will be backed by assets including U.S. auto plants, stock of subsidiaries including Ford Motor Credit Co. and Volvo, and up to $4 billion of domestic cash, the company said.
