The Canadian Auto Workers agreed to new contract concessions with Chrysler on Friday. General Motors Corp is under similar pressure to restructure on its own by June 1, or face the likelihood of bankruptcy. The company received a $4 billion lifeline from the Bush administration in December and has been promised $500 million by the Obama administration to cover its operations through April.

"It's something we want to see." Summers cited some gains in talks on multiple fronts but was not specific. "There are some issues that have been worked out and some issues that remain to be worked out," Summers said. Chrysler, the smallest and weakest of the once-vaunted Detroit-based 'Big Three" automakers, must substantially cut its debt and negotiate concessions on retiree health care and other matters with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union to satisfy federal requirements for its restructuring and be eligible for continued bailout assistance.

Chrysler employs more than 40,000 people. The autos task force determined in March that Chrysler could not survive as a stand-alone company and has pledged up to $6 billion in aid if the Fiat alliance moves forward. IT'S ABOUT CHANGE Although many analysts and other industry insiders believe a Chrysler bankruptcy would be the end of the iconic brand, Summers did not rule out that step in noting multiple contingencies are being considered.

He suggested a court filing would not necessarily result in a wind down of Chrysler's operations. "In certain circumstances, a bankruptcy is not about liquidation. It's about change in legal form that actually protects the company and enables it to function more effectively," Summers said. Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, was critical of how the administration has pressured lenders and believes Chrysler is bound for bankruptcy unless there is a sudden and unexpected turn of events.

The Treasury did not respond publicly, but Democratic U.S. Rep. Gary Peters, whose district covers Chrysler's headquarters outside Detroit, called it inadequate. U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said on Saturday in Detroit that it was time for creditors, especially those who have accepted public funds as part of the government's bank bailout program, to make concessions and "be part of the solution." Debt restructuring also factors into finalizing a proposed alliance with Italy's Fiat SpA, the lone working alternative to rescue Chrysler operations and preserve as many of the company's jobs as possible.
