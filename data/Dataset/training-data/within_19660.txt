Entertainment website IGN praised "Grand Theft Auto 4" for showing the effects of depravity on the main character. "'GTA IV gives us characters and a world with a level of depth previously unseen in gaming and elevates its story from a mere shoot-em-up to an Oscar-caliber drama," IGN said. Critics saved some of their most fulsome praise for the game's setting, a fictionalized New York called Liberty City, with distinct neighborhoods and colorful inhabitants who react intelligently to the player and each other.
