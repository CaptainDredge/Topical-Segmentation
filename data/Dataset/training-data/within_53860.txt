Unofficially, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) has been chosen as one of the underwriters, they said. Although an IPO is the most likely scenario, Hitachi is also considering a sale of all or part of HGST, several sources said. Shares in Hitachi, Japan's biggest electronics conglomerate, rose 2.1 percent on the news, outperforming a steady Tokyo electrical machinery sector subindex .IELEC.T. Hitachi, on track for its first annual net profit in five years, has been streamlining its sprawling operations that include 900 group firms to focus more on stable and growing infrastructure-related businesses such as power plants and industrial systems.

As part of the effort, it made five then-listed subsidiaries into wholly-owned units earlier this year, while reducing its stakes in other units such as those make chips and mobile phones, judging they fall outside of its focus areas. "An independent business structure is ideal for a business like this one where price volatility is so severe and there is the need for such big capital investment," a Hitachi executive who declined to be named said of the hard disk drive unit.

LOS ANGELES/TOKYO  (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) HIT.N is planning an initial public offering of its hard-drive unit in the United States, possibly by year's end, sources familiar with the situation said.The hard-drive unit, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST), is the world's No. 3 hard drive maker and analysts said it could be valued at about $3 billion, based on its revenue over the last 12 months and the value of its main competitors, Seagate Technology Plc ( STX.O ) and Western Digital Corp WDC.N. Bankers are in discussions with the Japanese company about an IPO and underwriters could be named in early September, the sources said.

"They are sort of cash-strapped, so this would get money to the firm, it would help them financially," said Hemant Hebbar, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. The outlook for the hard disk drive industry is uncertain, with PC demand seen weaker than previously expected, especially among consumers in mature markets. Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) last week warned of a sales shortfall in the third quarter.

HGST turned profitable in 2008 for the first time since it was founded in 2003 after Hitachi bought IBM's hard disk drive operations. HGST posted an operating profit of $186 million on revenue of $1.5 billion for the 2010 second quarter. Noble Financial Group analyst Mark Miller said some of HGST's business decisions in the quarter -- including boosting production in a tight market -- could be viewed as an attempt to gain market share and prepare for a spinoff.
