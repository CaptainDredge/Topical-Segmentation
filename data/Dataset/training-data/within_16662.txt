The report said Kerviel's deception included rogue deals on warrants with a deferred start date, futures contracts and "forwards" deals using a counterparty within SocGen itself. "The General Inspection department believes that, on the whole, the controls provided by the support and control functions were carried out in accordance with the procedures, but did not make it possible to identify the fraud before January 18th 2008," the report said.

BONUS CHASING Press commentators have said that one of the problems might have been that Kerviel was eager to please his bosses after failing to get a bonus of the same scale as his peers. The SocGen report said Kerviel got a 60,000-euro bonus for 2006. He asked for a 600,000-euro bonus for 2007 but instead received half that.

The report supported SocGen's previously expressed view that he acted alone. "At this stage of the investigations, there is no evidence of embezzlement or internal or external complicity (i.e. the existence of a third party who knowingly assisted the fraudster to conceal his positions)," the report said. "The investigations are continuing, in particular, to cover a wider area than the activities of the author of the fraud," it added.

By the time SocGen discovered what was going on in late January, Kerviel had amassed a position worth 49 billion euros which SocGen had to unwind between January 21 and January 23 in an already-falling stock market. The bank's woes have renewed speculation that it could be a takeover target for France's largest listed bank, BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ).

It also said SocGen was already taking measures to shore up its risk controls, including biometric security controls. The report comes a day before SocGen posts 2007 results. SocGen said last month it expected its 2007 net profit to fall 82 percent to 947 million euros, implying a 3.35 billion-euro loss for the fourth quarter alone.
