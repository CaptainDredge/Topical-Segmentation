French state television showed images of French families with children disembarking from boats in Libreville. One mother, who did not give her name, said she had wanted to leave Port Gentil because the situation there was frightening. SECURITY PATROLS A French resident of the oil city, who gave his name only as Pascal, told state television that he had seen the Total leisure center go up in flames from his residence.

But the French troops did not get involved in the overnight violence, according to media reports in France. Total said that for now the company planned to keep the transferred families at hotels in Libreville for the weekend and to move them back to Port Gentil when it was safe to do so.

French state radio station France Info reported two people had been killed during the night in the city, where looting broke out and protesters torched cars and buildings. The radio station quoted Gabon's Interior Minister Jean-Francois Ndongou as saying the dead were looters who were shot by a house owner. "Some Total employees and their families have been transferred from Port Gentil to Libreville in a temporary move for their safety," the Total spokeswoman in Paris said.

"We are not evacuating anyone from Gabon itself. We are simply taking the right measures for no one to find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time," said Jean-Philippe Magnan, head of Total's Gabon arm, speaking on France Info. The radio station said about 100 Total staff and members of their families had been taken out of Port Gentil.

Some Gabon opposition supporters suspect France, which has major economic interests in the country and a 10,000-strong expatriate community there, of having supported Ben Bongo. The French government, which maintained close links with Ben Bongo's father during his long rule, has strongly denied that.
