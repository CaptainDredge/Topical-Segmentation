Toyota, already the world's most valuable automaker with a market worth of $230 billion and poised to take over as the top carmaker by volume, kept its forecast for full-year operating profit of 2.2 trillion yen ($18.31 billion) and net profit of 1.55 trillion yen.

The result beat an average estimate of 559.2 billion yen in a survey of four brokerages by Reuters Estimates.
