A spokesman said "such transactions will have to be deducted from the investing bank's capital" under EU rules.

A spokesman for the National Bank of Slovakia said: "Yes, such loans are permitted, but there is no consequence on the field of capital deduction." Italy, Belgium, and Cyprus did not respond to questions from Reuters on the issue, nor did Britain's Financial Services Authority. Gleeson said: "This is one of the areas where a single regulator would be the only practical way of ensuring consistency between countries." Yannis Varoufakis, professor of economics at the University of Athens, was blunter about the way Greece allows banks to raise capital via loans from each other while the country relies on huge bailouts from the "troika" of the IMF, ECB and European Commission.

Sallas declined to answer questions on the issue. Piraeus is suing Reuters for an earlier story about the bank renting properties owned by companies run by Sallas and his family, and wants 50 million euros in damages.

A survey by Reuters of euro zone banking supervisors and central banks found that a majority agreed with Burghof's view, though Spain, Luxembourg and Slovakia supported Greece's position.
