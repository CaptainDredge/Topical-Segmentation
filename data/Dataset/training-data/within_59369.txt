* By February 2006, JPMC was gathering information on Madoff feeder funds run by Fairfield Greenwich Group; an employee wrote about concerns and questions, including how "from April to September 2002, the S&P 100 Index is down 30 per cent, cash yielded 1 per cent, and the Fund was able to generate over 6 per cent returns." * An April 2007 report by the bank's Equity Exotics unit dismissed risks, citing Madoff's reputation.

* In July 2007, bank officials met longtime Madoff business partner Sonja Kohn, a Vienna banker, who has also been sued by the trustee. It was "incredibly troubling and telling" to JPMC that she could not provide credible responses to a number of questions, the complaint said. * JPMC made an estimated $500,000 in fees and profits "off of the backs of BLMIS customers." * By the fall of 2008, JPMC was no longer comfortable with the risk of fraud and redeemed $276 million in investments in BLMIS feeder funds.

* The bank failed to probe irregularities in FOCUS (Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single) reports provided by Madoff's firm. * The bank was told several times that there was no independent process for confirming that trades were executed or assets existed at Madoff's investment advisory business. * JPMC knew the identity of Madoff's auditor as early as 2006 but conducted no investigation that would have revealed the small suburban accounting firm was "a very odd choice for a multibillion dollar investment enterprise, and an indication of fraud." * It wasn't until October 2008 that the bank reported any of its long-held suspicions of fraud to government officials -- the Serious Organised Crime Agency in Britain -- and that was part of an effort to protect its own investments.

-----

* JPMC conducted due diligence on BLMIS feeder funds in 2007 and 2008, but kept its findings a secret, despite concerns of fraud. * If large transactions through JPMorgan Chase that did not jibe with legitimate business purposes triggered any warnings, "they were suppressed as the drive for fees and profits became a substitute for common sense, ethics and legal obligations." * From 1986 on, all of the money that Madoff stole from his customers passed through BLMIS's account at JPMC, the so-called 703 Account, and the bank disregarded its own anti-money laundering duties.
