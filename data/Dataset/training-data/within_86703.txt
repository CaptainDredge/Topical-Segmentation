Jenkins was not asked to respond to the suggestion, but commented that the bank in recent years "became a bit short-term" in balancing sustainability goals. He pointedly added that in the divide between business and government "nothing is so short term as a politician up for election."

He discarded Diamond's goal of achieving a return on equity of at least 13 percent for one that simply beats the bank's 11.5 percent cost of equity. He also dampened speculation that he would radically alter his predecessor's emphasis on capital markets and investment banking, but otherwise provided few specifics about his plans.

A similar benchmark must be established at the Barclays Group level, Jenkins said, but declined to provide details about how short-term goals such as shareholder returns will be weighted against longer-term societal goals. In formal remarks at the conference, Jenkins said Barclays has stepped up for a second three-year commitment of 10 million pounds to establish microfinance savings and loans businesses in Third World villages.

In establishing a clear agenda for employee performance, the bank will be able to "relentlessly pursue" its objectives, including "becoming a source of good for society," he said during a presentation on environmental sustainability and social goals. The conference is run by a think tank started by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
