Of the 809 people surveyed, 38 percent said they spent less over the weekend this year than in 2007 and 18.9 percent said they spent more. The reminder said they spent about the same. "There's no way retail sales could be up when twice as many consumers spent less than more," Beemer said.

Beemer told Reuters on Sunday he expected to lower his forecast this week after seeing how consumers responded to his group's survey during the three days following Thanksgiving, the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season. Beemer will release his new forecast and full survey results later this week. But questions asked exclusively for Reuters gave a hint as to why he planned to lower his forecast further from a previous view of a 1 percent decline in holiday sales.

Last year about 25 percent of people said stores were understaffed. Retailers trying to maintain razor-thin margins in a declining economy and what some analysts say is the worst retail environment in almost two decades have been cutting costs where they can, including keeping hiring lean during the holiday season. Among other results, 89.6 percent of respondents said they could find the advertised sales items they intended to buy, compared with 92 percent in 2007.
