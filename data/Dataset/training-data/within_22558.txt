Dow has also secured $13 billion debt financing from Citigroup ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). It hopes to pay down some of this debt immediately after receiving the proceeds from its planned joint venture with Kuwait Petroleum Corp. The Rohm and Haas deal comes seven months after Dow sold a significant portion of its plastics assets into a joint venture with Kuwait Petroleum Corp for $9.5 billion.

Dow is one of the highest rated North American chemical makers. Moody's rates Dow Chemical "A3,", while Standard & Poor's and Fitch rate it "A-minus." For Berkshire, which will become Dow's largest shareholder, the deal is similar to the role it played in helping candy maker Mars Inc to buy chewing gum company Wrigley Jr Co WWY.N for $23 billion.

The all-cash deal for $78 per share is a 74 percent premium compared to Rohm and Haas Co's closing price of $44.83 per share on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Including Rohm & Haas' debt of $3.5 billion, the deal would be valued at $18.8 billion. Financing for the acquisition includes an equity investment by billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) and the Kuwait Investment Authority in the form of convertible preferred securities for $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively.

That deal, which is expected to close in toward the end of 2008, is intended to cut Dow's exposure to the commodity chemicals business. SHORT-TERM KNOCK Shares of Dow were down $1.77, or 5.2 percent, at $32.17 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal may weigh on Dow over the near term, according to BB&T Capital Markets analyst Frank Mitsch, who lowered his rating on Dow's stock to "hold" from "buy".

Dow's chief executive Andrew Liveris has advocated a strategy of beefing up its specialty business, whose end markets include paint, coatings, electronics, agriculture, transportation and water purification. The Rohm and Haas deal achieves this goal at one fell swoop. "It's a massive transformation," said Morningstar analyst Ben Johnson. "Dow has been for a long time talking about how they are committed to having more stable earnings throughout an entire economic cycle and this is evident of their commitment to that goal," said Johnson.
