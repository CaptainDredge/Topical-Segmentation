BERLIN  (Reuters) - Angela Merkel's new legal requirement to consult parliament on changes to euro zone bailout funds and the lack of detailed proposals to show lawmakers was behind a decision to split a European crisis summit in two, an aide said on Friday.Against a backdrop of reports that Germany and France are at loggerheads on how to deliver on their promise of a solution to the crisis by month-end, European leaders will meet on Sunday to discuss a Greek debt write-down and bank recapitalization.

Merkel's conservatives and main opposition Social Democrats -- whose support for extra powers for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was crucial last month in the German parliament -- were in agreement on rejecting French proposals to use the European Central Bank to leverage the rescue fund. "The path is closed for using the ECB to ease liquidity problems," Merkel was quoted as telling coalition deputies, while Seibert made it clear that the German position on this had not changed.

The FDP and  all other German parliamentary parties are represented proportionally on the 41-member budget committee, which has to approve all government expenditure. It is usually chaired by the main opposition group, meaning the SPD. The committee was due to meet on Friday and next Tuesday to consider the proposals Merkel brings from Brussels.

Carsten Schneider, the SPD's budget affairs spokesman, said his party agreed: "This would break taboos, and we, like the government, reject it." Germany and France, which have promised a definitive plan to stop contagion from Greece -- and to a lesser extent Portugal and Ireland, which have also received bailouts -- have made it clear there is no question of increasing the 440 billion euro EFSF nor Germany's maximum contribution of 211 billion euros.

But the leaders of the 17-nation single currency zone will have to meet again on Wednesday to give the German chancellor time to get a mandate from the Bundestag's (lower house of parliament) budget committee for any proposals from Brussels. This bears out fears that a September ruling by Germany's constitutional court giving parliament more say in how Germany responds to the crisis would slow down the 17-nation currency zone's reactions by forcing Merkel to consult MPs. Merkel's spokesman said there had to be two summits because there had not been time for the Bundestag committee to study proposals in detail -- and in German -- before Sunday, when the leaders of all 27 European Union members, then those of the euro zone, meet in Brussels at a crucial time in the crisis.
