Its cost of sales would likely be higher because of rising incentives, the company said. Toll shares were up $1.21 at $21.93 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At Wednesday's close, the stock was down 36 percent year to date, while the benchmark Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index had fallen 58 percent.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ) on Thursday reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, as a charge for the reduced value of its land came in at the lower end of the company's forecast.With $900 million in cash and more than $1.2 billion available under its bank credit facility, Toll ended the quarter better positioned than its competitors to weather the worst U.S. housing downturn in recent times, analysts said.

Excluding the write-downs, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based home builder posted a profit of 72 cents per share compared with $1.49 per share last year. Toll, whose loss was the first in its 21 years as a public company, forecast a sales decline for its new fiscal year but did not issue an earnings outlook for the period because of uncertainty in the housing market.

Analysts had been prepared for a loss of 79 cents a share, including write-downs, according to Reuters Estimates. The results in the latest quarter included noncash pretax write-downs of $314.9 million for developments open for sale, land and land options. Last month, Toll had estimated the write-downs at $250 million to $450 million.

So far, Toll has reduced the number of building lots it controls by 35 percent to 59,300 and developments to 315 from 325. It expects to cut that number to 300 by October 2008. Last week, Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) said it had sold 11,000 lots into a joint venture it formed with Morgan Stanley Real Estate, raising $525 million.
