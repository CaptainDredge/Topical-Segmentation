NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted a drop in quarterly profit on Friday, and its new boss said the second-largest U.S. oil company had plenty of work to do on its own project line-up without making any big acquisitions.Chief Executive John Watson also said there would be no refinery closures in the near term, despite a bad performance in the fourth quarter that weighed heavily on its bottom line.

The earnings figure was far short of the $1.70 per share analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, hit by a steeper-than-expected $613 million refining, marketing and transportation loss, versus a year-ago profit of $2.1 billion. Analysts were still encouraged by Chevron's reserve replacement of about 112 percent in 2009. Watson, on his first call with analysts since becoming CEO, said it was "quite premature" to talk of closing refineries, but he would seek cost cuts and aim for a 10 percent-plus downstream return through the cycle.

Chevron will merge its chemicals arm with the rest of the downstream business, and retain a spending bias that will shift its focus over time to exploration and production, he added. "We have favored upstream investment for more than the last decade. That has been a pattern I think you will see going forward," Watson said.

"It's like trying to run at 40 miles per hour in a boat while dragging an anchor," said James Halloran, energy advisor at Financial America Securities in Cleveland. Fourth-quarter profit fell to $3.07 billion, or $1.53 per share, from $4.9 billion, or $2.44 per share, a year before, with Chevron being hit by negative currency moves and a lack of derivative gains and a $600 million asset swap a year before.

The stock fell 1.02 percent to $72.19 on Friday, in line with the Standard & Poor's Energy index .GSPE. Earlier this week, ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) posted better-than-expected earnings as the firmer oil prices offset its weak refinery performance. Exxon reports fourth-quarter results on Monday.
