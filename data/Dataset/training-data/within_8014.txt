Workers in Rochester, New York, supported it. The Rochester and Lockport plants are among four that Delphi would retain under the deal. Members at a Kokomo, Indiana, local also voted about 64 percent to approve the deal. Delphi also has designated that plant as one it will retain following the reorganization.

It also may pit 13,000 recent hires against 4,000 veterans, who would take wage and benefit cuts. Thousands of long-term workers took retirements or buyouts in 2006 that allowed Delphi to hire replacements at lower wages and benefits. UAW members in Lockport, New York, voted against the deal by a wide margin, according to the Buffalo News.

Plants shut down for two weeks at the beginning of July. The deal also requires U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval. Overall, Delphi would retain four UAW-represented plants, turn over three to GM or a third party, sell four and exit 10. The agreement would cut wages for long-term employees from about $27 per hour to the $14 to $18.50 an hour of recent hires.

CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers is expected to announce results of a member vote on Friday on a deal that auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK says it needs to exit bankruptcy, with initial results from the union's local voting units pointing toward support.Voting on the agreement, which includes wage and benefit cuts and eventual plant closings, is cumulative among the eligible 17,000 UAW members, but results reported independently from some of the largest locals showed a majority in favor.

That remains above early Delphi demands for wage cuts to about $10 per hour. To make the wage cuts more palatable, long-term employees would receive $105,000 over three years and Delphi would extend offers of buyouts, retirement or returning to work at GM. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, still plans to exit bankruptcy by the end of 2007.
