Citi has raised nearly $50 billion since the beginning of the year by reducing assets and deleveraging, Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said in remarks posted on the bank's website. Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone said on Monday that Citi would take an additional hit $20.8 billion from problem asset write-downs, losses and building its credit reserves, but said the bank may avoid raising new capital to deal with the write-downs if it spreads the pain over four quarters.

"Our reserve of cash and highly liquid securities, which stood at $65 billion at the end of the second quarter and is essentially the same today, is up from $24 billion at year-end 2007," he said. As of the second quarter, Citigroup said it had a deposit base of about $800 billion, diversified across products and regions.

Trone maintained his 2008 loss estimate of $1.36 a share and his 2009 profit forecast of $2.14 a share. In its bankruptcy filing on Monday, Lehman LEH.N listed 30 of its largest creditors and said Citi's Hong Kong affiliate had made a $275 million bank loan to Lehman. Crittenden said the bank's Tier-1 capital ratio stood at 8.7 percent, "well in excess of the 'well-capitalized' regulatory minimums," and would improve in the fourth quarter when Cutu finalizes the sale of its German retail franchise.
