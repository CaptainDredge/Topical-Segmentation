Boeing ( BA.N ), up 2.2 percent at $70.87, gave the Dow its biggest boost after Bernstein Research said the 787 program "appears to be making substantial progress." Boeing, which marked its highest close since late June 2008, is the Dow's best-performing stock so far this year. "The volume is low again, the market hangs in there, (there's) no volatility," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at Cowen & Co. in New York "The market just can't get going (in either direction) and so we just slowly move up." Economic data was mildly supportive.
