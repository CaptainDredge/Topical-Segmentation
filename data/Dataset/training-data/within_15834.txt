"The Fed can do all they want but the problems are baked in the cake. There's nothing anyone can do to change that fact," said Jim Awad, chairman of W.P. Stewart Asset Management in New York. Gasparino's report "brought back all the worries about asset write-downs and credit worries. All that stuff we'd started to ignore based on the stimulus plan." In regular trading, the Dow Jones industrial average finished down 37.47 points, or 0.30 percent, at 12,442.83.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Wednesday, reversing strong gains after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates, roiled by fresh worries about more losses in the financial sector on fears big bond insurers will lose their top credit rating.CNBC's Charles Gasparino, the business channel's on-air editor, said he believed that the two biggest bond insurers will lose their top credit rating.

CNBC later posted a story on its Web site saying "it had learned" of possible bond insurer downgrades by Wall Street ratings agencies, without citing any source. There was more turbulence in after-hours trade. U.S. stock index futures slid after ratings agency Standard & Poor's said after the market's close that credit losses for financial institutions could eventually swell to more than $265 billion.

"Once he (Gasparino) started talking, we got the sell-off. As soon as that went across, those shares went down immediately," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. A credit downgrade of bond insurers could further harm the banking sector and stunt the global economy as financial institutions take a hit from subsequent write-downs of their assets.

In addition, S&P said it cut or may cut its ratings on up to $534 billion of subprime bonds. Shares of banks extended declines after the bell following the S&P statement. Shares of Citigroup Inc fell 1.3 percent after ending in regular trading at $27.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.
