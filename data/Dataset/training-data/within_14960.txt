SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) unveiled a lightweight laptop about three-quarters of an inch thick on Tuesday and said it would rent movies over the Web, moving the iPod maker into a very competitive market.Shares of DVD rental rival Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ) fell 2.5 percent to $22.20 and Blockbuster Inc BBI.N, the largest video rental chain, dropped 16 percent to $2.72.

Jobs said the new aluminum-skinned MacBook Air notebook was the thinnest computer available, at a maximum of 0.76 inches and tapering to just 0.16 inches. Priced from about $1,800, the MacBook Air bridges the gap between Apple's entry-level and high-end laptops, and analysts voiced concern that it could steal customers away from its more expensive products.

But Apple shares also fell, by more than 6 percent to $167.64 in afternoon trading, as investors had expected both developments after widespread speculation. "There wasn't the 'wow' factor from anything that Apple had to say today," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.

But Apple has struggled to find a big audience for Apple TV, a product designed to be a Mac accessory for watching Internet video on a computer or television and unveiled alongside the iPhone a year ago. "It's not what people wanted. We learned what people wanted was ... movies, movies movies," Jobs said.

Chief Executive Steve Jobs made the announcements at the annual Macworld convention in San Francisco, where last year he showed off the highly anticipated iPhone for the first time, setting a high bar for this year's event. Apple shares have nearly doubled since last year's Macworld, and in late December topped $200 for the first time.
