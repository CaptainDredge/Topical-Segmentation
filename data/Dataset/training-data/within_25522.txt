Yesterday, fed funds traded at 6 percent. We have financial institutions in trouble and no sign of inflation. So their inflation concerns seem to be misplaced. A 25- or 50-basis-point cut would have helped calm markets. I don't think they've cut enough. The Fed needs to cut short-term rates further to create a situation where financial companies could boost their earnings.

They pumped the market up with a $140 billion liquidity injection (through overnight repos on Monday and Tuesday), and if I had to choose between that and a 50 basis point cut today, which is more symbolic -- I'd choose the $140 billion. The Fed is doing what they need to do, they are pumping the market with more liquidity, and that is the right thing."  CHARLIE SMITH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, GREENTREE, PENNSYLVANIA: "I think the Fed would have liked to have had some resolution with AIG ahead of this decision, but obviously they didn't get it, so it's steady as she goes." "The language was stronger on inflation than I would have expected, given that the CPI number that we got was so tame." "Treasury (market) moves I think you have to put in the context of what's happened in the past four or five days.

"The market has taken it pretty well, so at least that's encouraging. If this lack of a rate cut presages some sort of long guarantee from the Treasury or Fed to keep AIG from going under, it could be a net positive. But I'm still surprised."

Right now the lack of the Fed move on interest rates might send a bit of confidence to the markets that things are not as bad as they had thought and that once we clear this AIG problem it will be getting better. It is interesting that they say the risks remain balanced between growth and inflation, so it's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out through the rest of the day."  ANTONIO SOUSA, CHIEF STRATEGIST, DAILYFX.COM, NEW YORK: "The Fed has disappointed the market today by keeping the rates unchanged.

The 30-year is at levels we haven't seen since the early 1960s. Any blip we get as a result of the Fed decision I don't think is going to mean that much."  BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: "It seems rather irresponsible simply because we have such stress in the system.
