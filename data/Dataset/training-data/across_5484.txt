"Demand remains strong in North and South America," Agco CEO Martin Richenhagen said. "We expect these conditions to remain positive throughout 2011." Bearings maker Timken beat forecasts by a wide margin, partly because of higher demand from off-highway, rail and heavy-truck markets. Shares rose 4.3 percent to a record high.

Ford's U.S. sales plunged 44 percent in the first two months of 2009, compared to a market that declined 39 percent overall. Hyundai's sales rose 5 percent over the period. Ford is the only U.S. automaker that has not sought government funding to survive the severe downturn. Ford's two domestic rivals General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC have relied on $17.4 billion of government loans to survive since the start of the year and are required to push for sweeping restructurings in the next months to access more funding.
