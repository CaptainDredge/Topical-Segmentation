His decision to give the green light to a hefty settlement just days later has been viewed as a climb-down, but he maintains the support of investors and is likely to survive. "I don't think Peter Sands's reputation has been damaged much by the affair. The fact that his robust defense doesn't quite gel with the size of the fine would be the only real concern," said one of the bank's biggest 40 shareholders.

Simon Morris, a lawyer at CMC Cameron McKenna, questioned why the bank had paid such a hefty fine following its strong denial of the allegations. Sands said last week that only a tiny proportion of the bank's Iran-related deals -- worth less than $14 million -- were questionable under U.S. sanctions rules.

"Negotiations are going on between the other agencies, and we are talking to them. It is safe to assume we are now seeking a collective agreement with the other agencies," a spokesman for the bank said on Wednesday, declining to put a time frame on the process. The spokesman had earlier said a collective deal with the other agencies was likely.

Shares of Standard Chartered rose 4.1 percent to close at 1,429.35 pence, still well below their value before the accusations against the bank on August 6. "I think Standard Chartered wanted to settle because the share price had become destabilized," said one of the bank's 30 biggest investors. "Prior to that, I think they believed they had good legal grounds to resist a settlement of, say, under $200 million on the basis of the history of these cases." New York's financial services superintendent, Benjamin Lawsky, described Standard Chartered as a "rogue institution" for breaching U.S. sanctions by concealing information about funds linked to Iran.

Subsequently he said this was not the case, only that a collective agreement was the outcome the bank was seeking. Having cut short a family vacation in Canada last week, Chief Executive Peter Sands is now pushing for a comprehensive deal that removes lingering uncertainty. The bank is still the subject of probes by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Justice Department and New York prosecutors.
