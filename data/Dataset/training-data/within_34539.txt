"The acquisition of CV Therapeutics represents a unique opportunity to complement and strengthen our growing cardiovascular portfolio," Gilead Chief Executive John Martin said in a statement. The bid tops Astellas' $16-a-share offer, which was announced in January. Astellas turned hostile after the board of CV Therapeutics rejected the offer, saying it undervalued the company.

Gilead said the transaction would be dilutive to its earnings in 2009, neutral to accretive in 2010, and accretive in 2011. Gilead executives said in a conference call with analysts that the deal had a break-up fee of 2 percent to 4 percent.
