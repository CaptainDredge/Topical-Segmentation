LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - The enormous $300 million Boeing Co ( BA.N ) 747-8 Intercontinental parked at this week's Paris Air Show is earmarked for an anonymous VIP customer who apparently needs one of the world's biggest airplanes.In fact eight of the 33 orders listed for the plane on Boeing's website are attributed to "Business Jet/VIP customers." Be it a government, head of state or wealthy family, the company guards the identity of customers if they request it.

Lund said that, occasionally, requests are particularly interesting, such as one customer's desire for an elevator. "They would like a design for an elevator that comes out of the cargo bay so that the distinguished dignitaries don't have to walk up the stairs, but they could walk into a ground-level elevator and be raised into the airplane," she said.

Air Force One, which carries the president of the U.S., is one of two customized 747s. Lund said VIP customers for planes as large as the 747 often request extensive modifications -- often bedrooms or extra bathrooms -- to accommodate the special needs of the primary passengers and their entourages. Such modifications typically are done outside of Boeing, but the company must sign off on the changes.

But that doesn't stop the rest of the world speculating. "VIPs are clearly oil money," said Alex Hamilton, aerospace analyst and managing director of EarlyBirdCapital, who attended the air show. The Intercontinental can seat 467 passengers and lists at $317.5 million. Germany's Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) has ordered 20 and is set to be the first airline to bring the new jumbo into service, early next year.

"I think people in different cultures, some of them really want to be a little bit more anonymous. It's a large expense," Elizabeth Lund, vice-president and general manager of the 747-8 program, told Reuters during a tour of the plane. "Not everyone who buys a big yacht announces they have bought a big yacht." She said that none of the anonymous Intercontinental buyers is from the United States, adding that buyers are commonly heads of state.
