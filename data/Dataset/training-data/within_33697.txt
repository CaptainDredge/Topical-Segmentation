They backed a doubling of funds for the International Monetary Fund, which has spent billions of dollars in recent months shoring up economies in eastern Europe and elsewhere. The leaders also agreed to strengthen the supervisory role of the Financial Stability Forum, a group set up by rich countries after the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, and enlarge it to include emerging economies.

The Berlin meeting took place after a week of tit-for-tat accusations of protectionism between European nations, with some of France's partners objecting to its plans to offer 6 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in state loans to domestic carmakers. In the final statement, the leaders commit to implementing stimulus measures and financial rescue plans in a manner that "limits distortions to competition to an absolute minimum." New tensions within the single currency bloc and the financial woes of European Union members to the east had threatened to overshadow the meeting in the German capital.

"This is especially true for those private pools of capital, including hedge funds, that may present a systemic risk." The statement also said a list of uncooperative jurisdictions, or tax havens, should be drawn up and a "toolbox of sanctions" be devised as soon as possible. Germany has led a drive to crack down on countries like Liechtenstein and Switzerland, following a tax evasion scandal last year that ensnared prominent Germans.

Since a first G20 summit on reforming global finance was held in Washington in November, recessions in Europe and the United States have deepened, forcing governments to push through massive stimulus packages that have raised fears of a return to protectionist policies seen in the 1930s. "We're dealing with an extraordinary international crisis the likes of which we have not seen for decades, both as regards financial markets and the global economy," Merkel told reporters at the end of the summit.
