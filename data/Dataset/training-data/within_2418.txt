CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was sworn in on Wednesday for a new six-year term and vowed to press a radical socialist revolution including nationalizations that have roiled financial markets.Emboldened by his landslide re-election win, the typically combative anti-U.S. leader kept up his attack on private property, proposing a constitutional reform that would wrest control over the natural gas sector back to the state.

He cited passages of the bible praising the redistribution of wealth, but gave no details to flesh out his nationalization plan against utilities, leaving investors to guess whether he wants the state to have a majority stake or 100 percent control. But his new economy minister told Reuters the government ruled out using confiscation to nationalize leading telecom CANTV and was studying mechanisms to possibly compensate shareholders for the takeover.

The man who calls Cuban President Fidel Castro his mentor changed tradition by draping the presidential sash from his left shoulder instead of his right in what he says is a symbol of his socialist credentials. Investors took fright this week at the leftist drive that further consolidates power in the hands of a former coup leader who already controls Congress, the courts and says he has total support in the army and the OPEC nation's state oil company.

A leading anti-U.S. voice in the world and in the vanguard of a shift to the left in Latin America, Chavez now wants to scrap presidential term limits and stay in power for decades. Chavez, who won 63 percent of the vote in December, reiterated he wants new powers to rule by decree.

BLANK CHECK FROM VOTERS? Buoyed by strong oil prices and high popularity, Chavez is expected to ride out any economic and political storm -- especially because crude revenues and not Venezuela's economic policies generally lure investment into the country. In his political career, the former army officer has survived jail, a coup and a recall referendum.
