AIG has had a total of four chief executives since last year. In the course of its review, the SEC wrote to three of those, the letters show, starting with Martin Sullivan, who was forced to resign in June 2008. Robert Benmosche, a former MetLife chief, replaced Liddy as AIG CEO one week ago.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The adequacy of AIG's disclosure on derivatives that drove it to the edge of collapse was questioned by regulators months before the insurer's federal bailout last September, according to newly released correspondence.A series of letters between April 2008 and June 2009 were posted on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website on Monday.

PRE-BAILOUT QUESTIONS In a September 5 letter to Robert Willumstad, who was CEO before Ed Liddy, the SEC said AIG could do much more to help investors understand its risky book of derivatives. The letter was written just 11 days before AIG begged for a multibillion-dollar line of credit from the U.S. Federal Reserve, saving it from bankruptcy.

The correspondence sheds light on specific concerns the SEC had about information provided to investors in AIG regulatory filings. In a December 19, 2008, letter to then American International Group ( AIG.N ) Chief Executive Ed Liddy, an SEC official questioned an "apparent inconsistency" in the way AIG described the risk of losses from credit default swaps it had sold to European banks.

Benmosche has the unenviable job of trying to sell off enough of AIG's businesses to repay its $80 billion taxpayer debt. The company is also trying to unwind trillions of dollars of trades and positions held by its financial products unit, thereby cutting the risk of being struck again by giant derivatives losses.
