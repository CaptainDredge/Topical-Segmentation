NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank by market value, said on Monday its quarterly earnings will drop 60 percent on $5.9 billion in losses and write-downs from subprime and leveraged loan woes, fixed income trading, as well as weakness in its consumer business.The profit warning came on the same day that Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) disclosed $3.4 billion in losses, driven by some of the same factors, and raised questions about whether other banks that have not yet reported third-quarter results will also warn.

One prominent analyst, Mike Mayo, called for Prince to step down, and others said investors were hoping he would go. "The only reason the shares are up is people are betting this guy (Prince) is gone," said William Smith, chief executive of SAM Advisors LLC, which owns Citigroup stock. Prince made headlines in July when, asked by the Financial Times newspaper about the possibility of a retreat from the leveraged loan markets, said the bank was "still dancing." Citi declined to comment on Mayo's call for Prince's departure.

Citigroup shares were up 2.4 percent despite the warning, after Charles Prince, the bank's embattled chief executive, said he expected the bank "to return to a normal earnings environment in the fourth quarter." Analysts said they were betting that, like weaker results last month at investment banks including Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) and Lehman Brothers LEH.N, Citi's stumble could be a one-time thing.

"As is evident, the market disruption had a severe impact on our results in markets and banking," Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said in a recorded call. "However, our performance was below expectations even taking into account turbulent market conditions." The profit warning may put renewed pressure on Prince, who this week marks his fourth anniversary at the helm of the banking group and who has been criticized by some shareholders for Citi's share underperformance and for growth in costs that has outpaced profit increases.

Citi also said it was taking $1.3 billion in pretax losses on the value of leveraged loans and subprime mortgage bonds it had planned to repackage into bonds called collateralized debt obligations. And the bank had $600 million in losses on fixed-income trading, which Prince blamed on "significant market volatility and a breakdown in pricing relationships." 'BELOW EXPECTATIONS' Citi acknowledged that its performance was disappointing, even considering the market turmoil.
