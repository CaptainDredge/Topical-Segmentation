Letters released on Tuesday showed the Financial Services Authority - Britain's financial watchdog - had long shared its concerns with Agius about his bank's behavior and culture. "The cumulative effect ... has been to leave us with an impression that Barclays has a tendency continually to seek advantage from complex structures or favorable regulatory interpretations," said an April 10 letter sent by FSA Chairman Adair Turner to Agius.
