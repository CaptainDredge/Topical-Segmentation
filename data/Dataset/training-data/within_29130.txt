But he said he believes the banking system has been stabilized. "No one is asking themselves any more, 'Is there some major institution that might fail and we would not be able to do anything about it?" Paulson told National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" program. "I think our major institutions are stabilized." Regarding his announcement on Wednesday to shift the bailout program's focus away from purchasing mortgage-related assets, he said this was necessary because the scale of the crisis meant that Treasury needed a "more powerful," faster plan to shore up bank capital.

"I think it would be harmful to see a bankruptcy of a major auto manufacturer, particularly during this period," Paulson told public television's "The Newshour With Jim Lehrer." "And so, clearly, I am of a view you should do something for the auto industry," he said. But Paulson said using the Treasury's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief program to help Detroit was not he right approach because the rescue plan was intended to stabilize financial institutions and prevent a major banking system meltdown.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday encouraged Congress to come up with the funds to help ailing Detroit automakers, but stuck to his position that the government's $700 billion bailout fund is for financial institutions only.In interviews broadcast on Thursday, Paulson said General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Chrysler LLC were important to the U.S. economy and he didn't want to see any of them filing for bankruptcy protection.

But he said that any federal aid must be accompanied by a plan to put GM, Ford and Chrysler on a path toward long-term viability. He stopped short of saying the companies do not have viable strategies to survive on their own, but said, "You've got to ask that question of any company that might be on the brink of failure." BANKING SYSTEM STABILIZED Paulson said the U.S. economy was in for more difficulty until housing prices stabilized and recovery would take a long time.

He told Bloomberg Television that injecting capital directly into banks was more effective. The Treasury will devote a relatively small amount of the bailout funds -- "much less" than the fund's second $350 billion -- toward shoring up consumer credit markets. Paulson said under this program, investors holding top-rated asset-backed securities could borrow against them from the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis, to invest in securitized consumer debt and mortgages, providing more liquidity and credit for households.
