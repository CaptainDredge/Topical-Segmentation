Barclays wants to increase its exposure to fast growing markets in Brazil and Asia while the consortium would seek to beef up operations in Europe, a sector ripe for consolidation. ABN, which has until June 14 to appeal, had argued the sale of LaSalle was not a "major transaction" requiring approval, as it amounted to less than a third of the bank's total value.

AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - A Dutch court told ABN AMRO AAH.AS on Thursday to freeze its $21 billion sale of U.S. unit LaSalle, dealing a blow to its agreed takeover by Barclays ( BARC.L ) and making it easier for a rival group of suitors to bid for the whole of ABN.Barclays said it would push ahead with its $88 billion merger with ABN, which has the blessing of ABN's management, but sources familiar with the matter said the Royal Bank of Scotland would go forward with a counterbid for LaSalle against the $21 billion being offered by Bank of America ( BAC.N ) in order to clinch the Netherlands' biggest bank.

Dutch investor group VEB, with the support of shareholders representing up to 20 percent of ABN's shares, took its case to the Dutch commercial court in Amsterdam Saturday, asking for an injunction against the sale and an investigation. "This is a great, great victory for shareholders," said Peter Paul de Vries, the VEB's chairman.

Investors, hedge funds and RBS, along with partners Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Fortis FOR.BR, had demanded that ABN put the LaSalle deal to a shareholder vote since it made it difficult for others to counterbid for the whole of ABN. The consortium has indicated that it is willing to pay as much as 72 billion euros for all of ABN, and will be allowed under Dutch regulations to make a public offer for the company as early as Friday.

The notice period needed for a shareholders' meeting at ABN is a minimum of 15 days, meaning the sale could now be on hold for as least that long. "Since the LaSalle deal is now blocked, (the trio) can come up with a formal bid where LaSalle can be one of the assets they can acquire," Jan Leroy, a fund manager at Petercam Asset Management said.
