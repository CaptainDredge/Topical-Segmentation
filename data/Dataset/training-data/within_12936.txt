Prince said that, despite the emphasis on better ingredients, calorie-packed pastries do not promote a healthy modern life. "They do not make an ideal daily meal for a commuter who rides the bus or train rather than walks or cycles to work," she said. "Pasties were Cornish miners' food, eaten by people who probably burned well over 5,000 calories a day." (Editing by  Sara Ledwith )

"Everyone loves a pie -- it reminds you of mum," said Martin Dewey, founder of the Square Pie chain, which he set up in London in 2001 to offer a more wholesome variety of pies. "But pies needed an update -- they had been neglected for too long." The Daily Telegraph newspaper has described his shops as "the crusted equivalent of haute couture", and some new pie start-ups have investors salivating at the potential easy cash flow and Starbucks-like growth of small stalls offering busy Britons a wholesome, more British alternative to burgers.

Part of the new brands' appeal lies in local ingredients and fillings that reflect modern Britain, with recipes stuffed with curries, coconut milk and spicy jerk chicken. Others use online marketing: Pieminister's Web site mixes animated graphics with a link to its MySpace page, and a parody of the corporate promise: "You must promise to love your pie, enjoy him, cherish him and above all cook him properly." They also tap into tradition, especially at West Cornwall Pasty.

"We've been doubling our annual sales for several years running, and we're selling about 25,000 pies a year now," said Jonathan Simon, co-founder of Bristol-based Pieminister, which offers its pies wholesale, retail and online. "It's one of those products everyone knows but is often disappointed with -- there's lots of room for high quality pies," he said.

In the wake of industrialization, pies became cellophane-wrapped rubbery microwave fodder, mass-produced on assembly lines and often oozing with fat and additives. Britain's culinary revolution has forced the dish out of hiding. New chains selling traditional hot pastry-wrapped delights have sprung up throughout the country, many with the focus on quality and fresh ingredients.
