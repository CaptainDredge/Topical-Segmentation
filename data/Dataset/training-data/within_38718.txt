While members of the Fed's Washington board are confirmed by Congress, the presidents of the 12 regional banks are named by local boards of directors, with the consent of the Washington board. Some Fed officials think some lawmakers would like to make regional Fed presidents answerable to Congress.

The U.S. central bank has faced heightened political scrutiny after a series of high-profile bailouts of financial firms that have seen it put taxpayer money at risk.

The Fed would be called upon to propose recommendations by October 1, the document said. The document said that once the Fed issues a report, the Treasury would consider the recommendations and propose "any changes to the governance and structure of the Federal Reserve that are appropriate to improve its accountability and its capacity to achieve it statutory responsibilities."

The Fed has invoked this authority on numerous occasions since the financial crisis struck. The document said that in each case during the crisis the Fed had sought and received the approval of the secretary, but that requiring prior written approval would "provide appropriate accountability going forward." In an interview with Reuters Television in May, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, the former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said the Fed's structure had served it well by providing a diverse set of viewpoints.
