TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan, the world's second-largest economy, became the latest country on Friday to signal that the worst of the global financial crisis may be over.The news though did little to lift the mood of investors, who fretted instead over concerns that the United States could lose its top-level AAA credit rating.

The central bank did not update its numerical forecasts for growth or other key indicators, or mention if its less bearish outlook had affected its views on whether it should buy more Japanese government bonds (JGBs), which would push more money into the economy to spur growth. The Nikkei business daily reported on Friday that as an extra stimulus to keep credit flowing and save jobs, the government planned to set up a lending scheme worth up to 4 trillion (267 million pounds) yen to encourage banks to lend to large and medium-sized companies.

The concerns weighed on stock markets and pushed the dollar to a five-month low against major currencies. The Bank of Japan upgraded its view on the ailing economy for the first time in almost three years while keeping interest rates on hold, noting that steep declines in exports and output were levelling out.

"The pace of deterioration in the Japanese economy will likely moderate and the economy will likely stop deteriorating," the central bank said in a statement. "Financial conditions remain severe, although tensions have eased." The assessment was the latest in a series of more upbeat forecasts by policymakers around the world, who increasingly believe the global economy is past the worst.

Asian stocks were generally lower, after giving up early gains. Despite increased optimism that a recovery is starting, there remain doubts about how sustainable it will be, and some think markets have risen too fast in recent months. The weaker dollar also helped pull export-oriented Asian stocks lower.
