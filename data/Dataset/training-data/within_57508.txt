But its effective lending capacity is smaller because when its raises money on the market, its bonds have to be either backed by countries with a 'AAA' rating, or by cash, to be rated triple A themselves. BNP Paribas said in a research note that because only six euro zone countries now have a triple A rating and together account for just over 58 percent of the guarantees for the EFSF, the effective lending capacity is just 255 billion euros.

Ideas could take more concrete shape next year if markets put pressure on Portugal to follow Greece and Ireland by seeking financial help. The euro zone would then want to ringfence the next potential aid candidate, Spain, whose size would stretch available EU funds. "Early next year, when we will see many  euro zone countries going into the markets to get new funding in the markets, then tension could come up," ING economist Carsten Brzeski told Reuters Television.

The IMF now provides a third of the total amount of euro zone bailouts -- a proportion that could be increased. In April 2009, G20 leaders agreed to quadruple the financial capacity of the IMF with a $1 trillion commitment. "The 1 trillion was raised globally and some countries are already grumpy that a lot of it is going to Europe," the euro zone source said.

"If nothing works and the markets do not calm down, then eventually we will have to do something and we can either raise the effective amount, or raise the actual amount of the EFSF," the euro zone source said. Asked about the chances of boosting the EFSF's size, the source said: "It depends on what the alternative is." "Raising the guarantee amount from 120 percent to something would be easier than raising the 440 billion to 880 billion and that would be simpler than a euro bond, which in turn would be simpler than buying Irish bonds outright in the market." BOOST LENDING TO IMF TO BOOST IMF SHARE IN FINANCING Because both changing the parameters of the EFSF as well as increasing its size could be difficult politically -- notably in Germany, where public opinion is opposed to bailing out others -- another idea is to lend more money to the IMF and increase the IMF's share in bailouts of euro zone countries.

"The IMF has this formula that they cover a third of a program, so if Europe would like to have more from them they would just say: 'Give us more money'. It might be politically easier for governments to give money to the IMF than to the EFSF." EURO ZONE BONDS The chairman of euro zone finance ministers Jean-Claude Juncker and Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti called last week for the issuance of joint European sovereign bonds, so-called "E-bonds." The call quickly ran into opposition from Germany, which said there were legal and economic hindrances that would require fundamental changes to the European Union's underlying treaty.
