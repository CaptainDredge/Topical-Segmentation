"If a deal had been reached it would have been a plus (for ANZ). Now it is business as usual. ANZ's discipline here must be commended," Paul Xiradis, chief executive at fund manager Ausbil Dexia, said. Ausbil Dexia owns ANZ shares. Shares in Hana closed down 1.8 percent, ending an eight-day winning streak, while ANZ ended up 0.9 percent, the only gainer among top Australian banks.

KEB emerged in the auction at the last minute, outbidding ANZ, which had reviewed KEB books since August. ANZ had been considering paying a maximum of $4.5 billion for 57 percent stake held by Lone Star and Korean bank KEXIM, close to both book and market value, according to sources. Hana said it may also buy KEXIM's 6 percent stake in KEB after discussing with the second-biggest shareholder of KEB.

Another source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), the top shareholder in Hana with an 8.66 percent stake, would provide financial support for the deal. Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed all of Hana Bank's ratings on review for possible downgrade amid market concerns that the core unit of the parent Hana group may be forced to raise dividend sharply to fund the acquisition.

The firm was later cleared of any wrongdoing. Bankers and analysts have said ANZ will now look for other Asian investment opportunities, including Indonesia's Bank Panin ( PNBN.JK ) and Thai Military Bank TMB.BK. "Michael Smith knows Asia well," Xiradis of Ausbil Dexia said, referring to ANZ's chief executive, the architect of the bank's Asian growth strategy.

ANZ also said it will remain focused on Asia. "ANZ will continue to focus on organic growth in Asia and to evaluate strategic opportunities as part of its aspiration to build a super regional bank," it said in a statement.
