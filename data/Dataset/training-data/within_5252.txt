But a Dow spokesman, Chris Huntley, said, "We harness tremendous power from integration, we are not going to move away from that strategy ... so a friendly takeover is not going to happen."

Hassan Ahmed, an analyst with HSBC, said Dow has about $3 billion in cash and, based on conservative estimates, is in a position to generate about $14 billion in distributable cash over the next five years.

The report, which quoted sources close to the deal, said at least half of the capital is being provided by investors from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE and Oman, with the rest contributed by a number of U.S. buyout firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL. Dow said it would not comment on market rumors and speculation.
