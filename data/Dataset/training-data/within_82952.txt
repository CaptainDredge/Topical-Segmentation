Banks had achieved 76 percent of the total capitalization through measures such as retaining more of their earnings, issuing new equity and managing liabilities, the EBA said. Deleveraging measures had accounted for a reduction in banks' risk-weighted assets of only 0.6 percent compared with September last year, it said. Seven banks needed government help to meet the new threshold.

"A lot still needs to be done," Enria told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. "I'm very much aware this is not a silver bullet to resolve the difficult situation of the European banks. It's a very complex crisis we are in and we don't want to sound too upbeat on this" The EBA's recapitalization plan was part of a three-pronged approach that also deals with sovereign debt exposures and improving access to funding.

Those banks were Portugal's Caixa Geral de Depositos, Banco Comercial Portugues ( BCP.LS ) and Banco BPI ( BBPI.LS ), Slovenia's Nova Ljubljanska Banka, Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ) and Bank of Cyprus BOC.CY and Cyprus Popular CPBC.CY. The EBA did not include Spain's Bankia in the review following its bailout by the Spanish government.

Regulators and governments are concerned that aggressive deleveraging by banks is squeezing credit and hurting economic growth. Bank of England Policymaker Adam Posen said on Wednesday British banks were being excessively cautious in their lending practices. The EBA said banks had complied with its latest recommendation without having to reduce lending to households and companies or resort to a fire sales of assets.

Europe's banking watchdog had given banks until the end of June to hold core Tier 1 capital of 9 percent of risk weighted assets as part of efforts to restore confidence in the sector. EBA Chairman Andrea Enria said the recapitalization had been a "necessary and important step" but cautioned that banks had a long way to go to recover from the financial crisis and comply with new global regulations.
