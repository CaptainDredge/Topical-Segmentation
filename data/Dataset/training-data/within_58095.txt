It has assets of T$1.7 trillion ($56.5 billion) and lost T$12.7 billion in the second quarter of this year and T$12.5 billion in the third quarter. Taiwan Secom shares slipped 0.5 percent and Goldsun was off 1.8 percent, while the broader market  .TWII  was down 0.3 percent. AIG shares were down 3.2 percent at $56.19 in afternoon trading, making AIG by far the biggest decliner among S&P insurance shares .GSPINSC.

But local regulators blocked the deal and AIG was forced to put it back up for sale. The New York-based insurer got four offers for the business in the latest round, but on Tuesday home security company Taiwan Secom Group ( 9917.TW ) proposed buying a stake in Nan Shan and jointly running it with AIG.

"AIG is the only one that's making rules of the game," said an official of one of the four Taiwanese companies that had submitted bids. "They still have not told us what is coming up next." Nan Shan is Taiwan's No. 3 insurer by market share after the insurance arms of Cathay and Fubon.

Regulators have set five conditions for any buyer: show fund-raising ability for future operations; show a long-term commitment to run Nan Shan; show experience in running an insurance business; promise to take care of employees and policy holders; have funding sources that meet Taiwan regulations. A first deal to sell the AIG unit to Primus and Hong Kong-listed China Strategic ( 0235.HK ) was rejected after regulators said it did not meet all those conditions.

In a November letter to U.S. securities regulators that was not disclosed publicly until Tuesday, AIG said all of the bids it received for Nan Shan in the latest round were between $2.15 billion and $3 billion. The sale of Nan Shan is part of AIG's recapitalization plan, which is expected to close soon and will leave the U.S. Treasury with a 92.1 percent stake in the company.
