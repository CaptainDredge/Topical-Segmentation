COMPETITIVE RESPONSE Retailers have responded in various ways to Wal-Mart's move to offer cheaper drugs. Target Corp offers some generic drugs at $4 for a 30-day supply, while Kmart, a division of Sears Holdings Corp, offers some generic drugs at $15 for a 90-day supply. Last year, Publix Super Markets, a privately held U.S. grocer, and Meijer, a privately held retailer with stores in the U.S. Midwest, started giving away some generic antibiotics often taken for childhood ailments such as strep throat.

Agwunobi said the discount drugs program was being used by shoppers both with and without health insurance. He said he would not go into detail on whether the program was being used more heavily by customers without insurance. He also said Wal-Mart's offer to fill 90-day generic prescriptions for $10 would appeal to shoppers who currently use mail-order services to fill prescriptions.

Bernstein & Co, wrote in a research note. Later on Monday, Wal-Mart's rival Target Corp said it was cutting prices on prescription and over-the-counter medications. In 2006, Wal-Mart began selling some generic drugs for $4 per monthly prescription in Florida, and it quickly extended the program to all its U.S. pharmacies.

Derek Leckow, an analyst at Barrington Research, said the discount drug program has not had much impact on traditional drugstore operators because customers are not likely to drive further to a Wal-Mart to save the money. "The name of the game in this business is still convenience," he said. Soaring gasoline prices are another barrier to people driving an extra mile or two to Wal-Mart to have a prescription filled, he added.

Last year, it added more medicines to the program and said in September that $4 prescriptions accounted for nearly 40 percent of all prescriptions filled in its Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and Neighborhood Market pharmacies. The world's largest retailer said pharmacies at its U.S. discount stores, Neighborhood Markets and Sam's Club warehouse locations were now filling prescriptions for up to 350 generic medications, like diabetes drug metformin and asthma drug albuterol, for $10 for a 90-day supply.
