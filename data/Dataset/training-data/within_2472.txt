Wal-Mart first put its advertising into review as it soughtto shape a more polished image from the smiley-face logo and"Always Low Prices" slogan most associated with its image. The company has added more upscale items to its shelves,from flat-panel televisions to trendier women's clothing, butthe push has not been entirely successful so far.DEEP RETAIL EXPERIENCE  Wal-Mart Chief Marketing Officer John Fleming led thereview and said the agencies had been chosen for their "deepretail experience, recognized creativity and an understandingof our customers."
