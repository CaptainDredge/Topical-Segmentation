In August, Liberty said it plans to spin off its premium pay-TV network Starz LLC into a separate public company in a deal seen as taking a step closer to taking control of Sirius XM. Liberty Media said it was considering a tax-free spinoff of its 46 percent stake in the satellite radio provider.

Karmazin, who famously clashed with Sumner Redstone while at Viacom Inc, is known for his disdain of working for a controlling shareholder, and has indicated that Liberty likely wouldn't need him to stick around if it took control. Karmazin, who has been at the helm of Sirius for eight years, will step down on February 1, 2013, after the expiry of his employment agreement.

"While we understand, we regret Mel's decision to pursue other interests and are grateful for his willingness to oversee a smooth and orderly transition," Liberty CEO John Malone said in a statement.

Liberty, Sirius's largest shareholder with a stake of just under 50 percent, has been trying for months to wrest control of Sirius and has filed a petition with U.S. regulators to replace the company's board. Liberty has argued that Sirius should be more aggressive about pursuing better technology and expanding internationally.
