In the just-ended third quarter, sales volume declined in the Americas, hurt by decisions to stop selling unprofitable drinks, including some juices and bottled water packages where Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said there was "a hell of a price war." "We won't chase volume growth at all costs," Nooyi told analysts.

Revenue fell 5 percent to $16.65 billion, below analysts' average estimate of $16.90 billion. Excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations and the refranchising of its bottling businesses in China and Mexico, revenue grew 5 percent, reflecting 1 percentage point of volume growth and 4 percentage points from price increases. The results come a day after Coca-Cola also reported weaker-than-expected revenue, hurt by declines in Europe and the Pacific region.

The company has incurred restructuring charges of $193 million through the third quarter related to a productivity program. It expects additional charges of $205 million in the remainder of 2012, and $129 million from 2013 through 2015. So far this year, the company has also introduced Pepsi Next, a mid-calorie cola, and started a new global marketing campaign for its flagship Pepsi brand.

In the third quarter, overall sales volume rose 6 percent in the snack business, after acquisitions lifted sales in Latin America. In North America, volume rose 1 percent at Frito-Lay and 2 percent at Quaker Foods. PepsiCo's Americas Beverage business saw volume fall 3 percent. The company also affirmed its full-year outlook, which calls for earnings per share to fall 5 percent from the $4.40 it earned in 2011, and revenue to increase by a low single-digit rate reflecting the changes in China and Mexico.
