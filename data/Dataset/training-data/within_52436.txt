The Treasury has declined to adopt the recommendation, citing the prospect that it would prompt mortgage servicing firms to opt out of the program. It also has expressed concerns about fairness, as reductions in principal would help not only "responsible" homeowners hit by value declines, but also those who overleveraged their properties in refinancings.

For us to say we're going to have a finite number of people in each one of these programs could constrain us from the type of flexibility we need to deal with a dynamic problem." Barofsky, in a new quarterly oversight report, again pressed his recommendation that the Treasury consider making mortgage principal reduction mandatory instead of voluntary, saying this would do more to aid "underwater" homeowners, who owe more than their homes are worth.

"Treasury's continued indications that this is a successful program without identifying these goals and benchmarks is simply not credible," Barofsky told the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. "And I fear that the growing public suspicion that this program is an outright failure will continue unless and until Treasury adopts this recommendation and comes clean with what its goals and expectations are." The Treasury has stated its goal for the $75 billion Home Affordable Modification Program was to cut monthly payments for 3 million to 4 million "responsible" homeowners by the end of 2012 -- excluding speculators or those who bought vacation homes.

Warren, considered a leading candidate to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau signed into law by President Barack Obama on Wednesday, said the program had not kept up with the deterioration in the housing market. "It's too small, it's too slow," she said. "The program is based on the assumption that we will pay the servicers a bribe to make a deal between the homeowner and the investor who's still holding the paper and it has not worked well." U.S. Treasury officials defended their efforts, saying that monthly payments were permanently reduced for nearly 400,000 homeowners and the program was adapting to changing conditions by offering forbearance to unemployed people and extra funding for the hardest-hit markets.

The Treasury released figures this week showing it had assisted 1.3 million homeowners so far, but over 40 percent of them -- around 530,000 -- have dropped out of the program. In fact, more borrowers dropped out than those who achieved permanent status in June. Barofsky and Elizabeth Warren, who chairs the bailout Congressional Oversight Panel, told lawmakers the program was doing little to provide real housing relief.
