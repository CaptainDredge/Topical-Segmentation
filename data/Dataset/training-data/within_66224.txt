Here is a look at the steps Obama could consider: SALE OF ASSETS: Treasury could consider selling off some of the government's assets, including holdings of gold and mortgage-backed securities.

A further complication to changing the dates of the 80 million payments the government makes every month. The payments are automated so computers would need to be reprogrammed.

Other legal experts believe Obama does not have the authority to ignore the cap on borrowing set by Congress.

"I have talked to my lawyers," Obama said on Friday when asked about the option at a town hall forum.

Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser told Reuters the U.S. central bank, which acts as the Treasury's broker in financial markets, could not step in and borrow money on the Treasury's behalf.

But the Fed might need to become involved in some operational issues since it clears checks for the government for everyone from Social Security recipients to federal workers.

Geithner has dismissed this as unworkable.

Obama has warned that Social Security payments could be at risk without an increase in the debt limit.
