The devices are receiving less shelf space and less support from carriers." While Misek said that PlayBook sales for the first quarter were pretty good, he was disappointed by handset sales. His key question for the company is when it will launch QNX phones. "People are not waiting. They're going to other platforms," he said.

SHAW WU, ANALYST, STERNE AGEE "The guidance was surprisingly weak. Many expected some kind of reset, but it looks like they are doing a fairly big reset. But on the flip side it's actually good that they are setting expectations more realistically." "The outlook is definitely quite cautious. There was some expectations that it would be difficult, but this guide down looks probably worse than expected, and shows that the BlackBerry smartphones are definitely under some pressure."
