(Reuters) - The Obama administration and congressional Democrats are moving ahead with a broad plan to tighten financial regulation, gaining U.S. House of Representatives approval on July 31 of legislation to impose new curbs on corporate executive pay.Here is a summary of the overall financial regulation plan's components. Companies whose businesses could be at risk under the plan are listed under "political risk exposure." EXECUTIVE PAY: The House has approved a bill to give shareholders in public corporations annual, nonbinding votes on executive pay, while requiring more independence for compensation committees.
