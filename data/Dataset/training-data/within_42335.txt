NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Banks led by JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) reaped a bonanza of underwriting fees from debt and equity capital-raisings in the third quarter but a deepening slump in M&A activity depressed overall investment banking fees.Fee income from underwriting has become an important driver of bank profits this year, helping to offset big credit losses.

Issuance of high-yield bonds picked up in the United States and Europe, and there was also an uptick in initial public offerings at the end of the quarter. The banks look set to parlay this capital markets recovery into profits. JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, tops the "league tables" for both equity and debt underwriting fees for the year to date, at $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion respectively.

RECORD ISSUANCE Companies raised $168.9 billion in debt globally in the third quarter, taking the total for the first nine months of 2009 to a record $814.9 billion, the data showed. The combination of low interest rates and narrowing credit spreads has made financing cheaper for companies. It is not clear how long this will continue, however.
