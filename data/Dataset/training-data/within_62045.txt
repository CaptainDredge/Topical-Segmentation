"We think China is likely to frontload the tightening policy this quarter, riding on the still strong growth momentum. We expect one interest rate hike in June and one more reserve requirement ratio hike in April or May." WANG JIN, AN ANALYST AT GUOTAI JUNAN SECURITIES IN SHANGHAI "The economic figures in the first quarter are strong, but still within market expectations, and I don't think the economy faces the risk of overheating and the growth momentum will slow down in coming months.

"The government will keep battling inflation as its priority in coming months, which could prompt the central bank to further tighten its monetary policies in the second quarter. So we think the chance is fairly high for the central bank to raise interest rates in the second quarter. "We will not change our opinion that the economic growth may slow down in the next quarters, although the current figures do not quite support that trend.

"Inflation, of course, is the main issue in the short-term -- we think price pressures will ease in the second half of the year, but there is still more upside in the next few months, and the risk is that high oil prices will keep headline inflation stronger for longer. "This also suggests that policy rates still need to move higher in the months ahead, with Beijing also likely to favor further currency appreciation to help get inflation lower." ZHU JIANFANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITIC SECURITIES IN BEIJING: "From the GDP figure, we can see the whole economy is basically stable, but the inflation figure has surpassed market expectations.

And we think inflation for the second quarter will be around 5 percent." "I think the central bank will continue to raise reserve requirements and interest rates this year, and the benchmark interest rate may be increased to 3.5 percent." SUN MIAOLING, ECONOMIST AT CICC IN BEIJING: "The March CPI figure shows that the inflation pressure will not taper off in the short term and we expect the consumer inflation to remain at high levels in the second quarter.

"The central bank will stick to its tightening stance and we expect more rises in reserve requirements and interest rates." CONNIE TSE, ECONOMIST AT FORECAST IN SINGAPORE "The overall outlook offers limited room for policymakers to ease its tightening stance, especially amid strong capital inflows. "I look for another 100 bps worth of hikes in the benchmark 1Y rates for the rest of the year, which should bring the 1Y lending rate to 7.31 percent and deposit rate to 4.25 percent by year-end."
