(Reuters) - The Obama administration's plan for tightening financial regulation has been outlined by officials and sources familiar with discussions about its contents.Here are the main provisions, as presented by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, and as described by the sources: *CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY STANDARDS Financial institutions would have to thicken their capital cushions to absorb losses when times are tough, and make themselves more liquid, or be able to move quickly in and out of various holdings, "with more stringent requirements for the largest and most interconnected firms." *SYSTEMIC RISK REGULATION Large, interconnected firms whose failure could threaten the financial system's overall stability would face new consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve.

An inter-agency council of regulators with "broad coordinating responsibility" would also be set up. *SECURITIZATION Asset-backed securities issuers would face new reporting requirements, including loan-level data and compensation information on brokers, originators and sponsors. This information would be available to investors and credit-rating agencies throughout the life of a securitization. Securitization originators, sponsors or brokers would have to keep at least 5 percent of the performance risk in them.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles would be changed to eliminate immediate recognition of "gain on sale" by originators in a securitization, requiring instead that originators reflect income over the life of the assets. Fees and commissions received by loan brokers and loan officers would spread out over time and decline if a loan runs into trouble due to poor underwriting.

*RESOLUTION AUTHORITY A federal government mechanism would be set up for "orderly resolution of any financial holding company whose failure might threaten the stability of the financial system." Draft legislation for this "resolution authority" has already been proposed by the administration, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp expected to get this new duty.

"All derivatives contracts will be subject to regulation, all derivatives dealers subject to supervision, and regulators will be empowered to enforce rules against manipulation and abuse," according to a statement from Geithner and Summers.
