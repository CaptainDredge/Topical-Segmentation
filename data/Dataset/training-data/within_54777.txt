"We recognize our customers are eager to add the 747-8 Freighter to their fleets, and we understand and regret any impact this schedule change may have on their plans to begin service with the airplane," said Pat Shanahan, vice president and general manager, Airplane Programs, at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in a statement.

The delays to the 747 and 787 schedules have drawn criticism from customers, who are growing tired of the problems. "We've expressed our disappointment to Boeing about this development and the situation," said Dah Loh, director of investor relations for Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings ( AAWW.O ), which has twelve 747-8 Freighters on order.

The 747-8 delay was widely expected, and follows an August announcement by Boeing that it would push back first delivery of its long-delayed 787 Dreamliner to the first quarter of 2011. "We had assumed that a minor delay would cost Boeing $150 million, and so the lack of a charge is somewhat odd," said Robert Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a research note.

The 747-8 Freighter, about 18 feet longer than the 747-400, had been launched in November 2005 and was originally scheduled to start delivering in the fourth quarter of 2009. Boeing has 76 orders for the freighter model of the 747 at list prices between $293 million and $308 million. Boeing gets paid by customers on delivery.

Stallard reiterated an "outperform" rating on Boeing, noting a better outlook for commercial aircraft orders as air traffic improves. Shares of Boeing, a Dow component, rose as much as 3 percent on Thursday and closed up 0.9 percent at $66.54. Boeing said it would add a fifth airplane to its flight test fleet to help ensure the company meets the new schedule.
