The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. "Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability." * PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, JULY 22: "To keep inflation expectations anchored means that monetary policy-makers will have to back up their words with actions.

"When to begin this process, and how fast to move, will be difficult decisions. "While a 2-percent federal funds rate may be appropriate in a period of extreme economic weakness, if maintained for too long it could allow inflationary pressures to build over time." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JULY 16: "I couldn't agree with you more that inflation is a tax and that inflation currently is too high, and it's a top priority of the Federal Reserve to run a policy that's going to bring inflation to an acceptable level." "The housing market is really the central element of this (financial) crisis, and anything we can do to strengthen the housing market, to strengthen mortgage finance, would be beneficial" * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JULY 15: "The possibility of higher energy prices, tighter credit conditions and a still-deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth.

"Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated.

Helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority." "I think we're looking at the remainder of the year being probably positive growth but certainty not robust growth.
