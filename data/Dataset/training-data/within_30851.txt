The United States last endured a period of deflation during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Policy makers and economists fear this phenomenon of downwardly spiraling prices, earnings and economic activity because it is perhaps the most difficult problem to fix. In such periods, banks stop lending, consumers stop spending and businesses cut investments and lay off workers.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - No matter how bold the Fed's unprecedented plan to revive the U.S. economy, it is likely to take a stimulus package of as much as a trillion dollars to halt a precipitous slide into deflation.The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to the bone on Tuesday in its efforts to halt the economy's rapid descent and said it would employ "all available tools" to end a year-long recession.

"The fear of this economic cycle right now is could we get a risk of deflation -- of outright deflation that becomes spiraling in nature." With the enormity of the problem increasing by the day, it is unlikely that the Fed will be able to do the job alone. The Fed's liabilities have already burgeoned to more than $2 trillion in its efforts to stem the crisis and economists say now is the time for the government to step in with another stimulus package after one earlier this year.

HEY BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE $1 TRILLION? U.S. President-elect Barack Obama has repeatedly raised hopes of those calling for a substantial economic stimulus, promising a massive public works program to lift the U.S. economy out of recession. On Tuesday, he warned that the central bank was running out of traditional tools for fighting recession and said other branches of government needed to step up to help.

But the failure of its efforts so far to revive lending in the shaky U.S. financial system show the need for government spending to take over where monetary policy faces limits. "In a situation as dire as this, monetary policy on its own is not adequate to the job," said Nigel Gault, director of U.S. economic research at Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
