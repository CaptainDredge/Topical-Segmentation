NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell nearly a dollar on Monday as mild weather blanketed much of the United States, cutting into heating oil demand from the world's largest energy consuming nation.The drop in prices was limited, however, as dealers looked ahead to OPEC's meeting in Nigeria on Thursday at which the group's ministers will consider deepening a production cut to drain soaring world energy stockpiles.

U.S. crude prices slipped 77 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.28 a barrel by 1930 GMT, while London Brent crude fell 22 cents to $61.98 a barrel. "The mild weather should keep some pressure on prices," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president for energy risk management at Fimat USA. "The market is waiting for OPEC and inventory data or something substantial to move it." U.S. heating demand is expected to be nearly 27 percent below normal this week with warmer temperatures in most regions east of the Rockies, the National Weather Service said Monday.

According to a Reuters survey, the group that pumps more than a third of the world's oil has made about 730,000 bpd of the promised cutback, OPEC's first in two years. On Friday, OPEC President Edmund Daukoru said he favored a further cut to counter ample inventories, particularly in top oil consumer the United States.

U.S. crude oil inventories are at the highest level for this time of year since 1993. Some analysts say an additional cutback is not needed just as world oil demand is heading toward its seasonal peak during the Northern Hemisphere winter. "I don't think OPEC needs to cut any further because of winter demand and the impact of cuts they have already made," Mike Wittner, analyst at investment bank Calyon, said.

Even so, Saudi Arabia has told oil refiners in Asia that it will reduce their supplies next month. About half of the kingdom's 7 million bpd of crude exports move to Asia. The world's largest oil exporter kept supplies to European and U.S. refiners mostly steady, traders said. (Additional reporting Alex Lawler in London and Matthew Robinson in New York)
