European banks with large dollar requirements, especially now that regulators are pressuring them to better match dollar assets with liabilities, might prefer to stay out of the market as long as possible rather than ruin their yield curve with a widely priced deal. Even so, another $30bn of European fixed rate FIG issuance is predicted for the rest of the year, according to Barclays Capital's credit strategist Ryan Preclaw.

While higher quality European banks still have market access, "conditions are very volatile," he said. "Not only could it be very expensive, but depth may be limited." Dollar spreads have widened on European Yankee bank unsecured senior debt by anywhere from 25bp to as much as 140bp since their tightest levels in April.

US banks, battling concerns about their earnings potential in a continued weak economic environment, have suffered less, widening anywhere from 15bp on certain bonds, to 40bp from April tights. Although the market was still theoretically open to higher quality names, "if you came to market now the market would think you had pretty dire funding needs," said a New York FIG syndicate manager at a European bank in New York.

by Danielle RobinsonNEW YORK, June 16 (IFR) - Greece's precarious financial position has dealt a blow to the love affair US investors have had this year with European bank issuers in the investment grade dollar market. Borrowers from across the continent and the UK are watching their spreads gap out well beyond their Financial Institutional Group (FIG) comparables in the US, regardless of whether they have Greek exposure or not.

"There are definitely issuers who are looking at the market that ultimately may decide to stand down," said Dan Mead, managing director and head of FIG syndicate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
