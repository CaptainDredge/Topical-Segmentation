Core producer prices rose 3.6 percent over the last 12 months, the biggest year-over-year gain since May 1991. Crude goods prices were off 11.9 percent, the biggest tumble since April 2003. Receding wholesale price pressures will provide some relief for the Federal Reserve, which has lowered benchmark interest rates to 2 percent in a bid to buffer the economy from a deep housing downturn and tight credit, but has watched nervously as energy and food prices have pushed inflation to uncomfortably high levels.

This category led August's price declines. Gasoline prices fell 3.5 percent, the largest drop since April, and residential natural gas fell 5 percent, the sharpest slide since August 2007. Despite the recent ebbing of energy prices, wholesale prices still rose 9.6 percent over the last 12 months, the Labor Department said.

Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 0.5 percent decline. Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent as expected after a 0.7 percent surge in July that had fanned inflation fears. Energy goods prices tumbled 4.6 percent last month, the biggest drop since September 2006.
