On February 26, according to DataExplorers figures, about 2.5 percent of Citigroup's shares outstanding were out on loan to short sellers and other people who short stocks, but as of Monday about 15 percent of Citigroup's shares outstanding were out on loan. Now, the jump in short interest in Citi shares has coincided with positive news about the company and the banking sector from executives, triggering potential for a short squeeze.

But traders and other market observers are saying this is a unique kind of short squeeze, because in just a matter of days shares of Citigroup have become almost impossible to borrow. "Citigroup is the toughest short these days," said Rich Gates, founder of TFS Capital, which runs a short-long market neutral fund.

Traders said such worries about shorting Citi shares were one reason option volume in Citi skyrocketed on Wednesday. "A lot of shorts who were covering the (Citi) shares are now being told 'we no longer have the shares available' so someone somewhere may be sucking shares out of the market," Gates said.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Traders betting that shares of Citigroup ( C.N ) and other beaten down financial stocks will fall are finding it extremely difficult to borrow shares needed to make that bet, market participants said on Wednesday.Citi, which has received $45 billion of capital from the U.S. government, has seen its shares more than triple since their $1.02 close on March 5, as the outlook for the banking system has improved and short sellers have been forced to buy back shares.

Investors who sell securities "short" borrow shares and then sell them, waiting for the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference. Other companies with shares that have become increasingly difficult for short sellers to borrow include U.S. government-controlled home-funding companies Freddie Mac FRE.N FRE.P and Fannie Mae FNM.N FNM.P, and AIG ( AIG.N ), the former insurance giant that has received up to $180 billion in U.S. government bailouts, according to DataExplorers Ltd, a firm that tracks stock lending activity and short selling.
