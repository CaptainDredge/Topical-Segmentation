"The problem in the market is one of quantity and volume of assets coming on to bank balance sheets, and a deficiency of term liquidity to fund those," said Bond, speaking before the Bank of England and ECB left rates unchanged on Thursday. "Banks are hoarding any term finance they can get their hands on to fund these assets." London interbank lending rates for the euro fell 55 basis points on the day, responding to a 42 billion euro ECB injection of liquidity earlier in the day.

The Bank of England in taking steps on Wednesday to bring down overnight rates stressed that it was not seeking to guide three month rates lower, which it said were not being driven by central bank liquidity. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday that the bank would launch a supplementary long-term refinancing operation with no preset allotment.

If the CP turn into loans and the bridge loans turn into assets this could cause capital adequacy issues in the absence of new sales of bank bonds or equity. Banks are selling debt, but it is not an overnight process and not easy for all to do at the same time at an acceptable price.

At the same time, the banks look like getting stuck with something like another $300 billion of bridge bank loans extended to private equity and other acquirers under very aggressive terms. These loans may now be difficult or impossible to sell. Tim Bond, head of global asset allocation at Barclays Capital, estimates that the asset backed commercial paper market together with bridge loans represents 9 percent of banks' assets.

It's easier to answer the first question than the second. The problems with U.S. mortgages and structured finance has shaken the faith of the world's lenders in the value of collateral and the credit ratings upon which the whole edifice has been built. The asset backed commercial paper market, where many of the people who made such mortgage loans found financing, has partially shut, with many unable to get funding and many now only able to get it for a week at a time, where previously they might have obtained 30 or 60 day loans.
