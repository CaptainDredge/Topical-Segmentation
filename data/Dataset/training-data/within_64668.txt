But as U.S. regulators craft capital rules that could be severe, banks feel pressed to raise equity capital, analysts said. Banks' willingness to issue shares shows they may fear regulators more than shareholders now, which illustrates how the financial crisis has created a shift in the balance of power in the banking world.

"Although there is no such thing as a pre-approval, we have tried to reach out and work as closely as we can with a large number of regulators" in advance to make sure the deal will pass their tests, Perlin said. By the time Capital One issues the new stock and closes the deal, the bank expects at year-end to have raised its common equity capital from 8.4 percent of risk-weighted assets in March to 9 percent, a level bank executives believe regulators will judge to be prudent.

The financing option is being lost even in cases in which relatively strong banks are picking up orphaned assets, which should please regulators. "We're getting equity requirements each time we do one of these acquisitions," Bove said. RBC's 424 branches are losing money and their prospects are better with PNC, which is known for overhauling the broken National City Corp after buying it during the worst of the financial crisis.

PNC does not know how much that surcharge will be, so it included in the deal the option to issue $1 billion of stock to RBC, said William Demchak, senior vice chairman of PNC, on a conference call with investors on Monday. "It is an unknown at this point and not to put it in there as a possibility, I think, was wrong," he said.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. banks including PNC Financial Services Group ( PNC.N ) and Capital One Financial ( COF.N ) are using shares to help pay for even small acquisitions, in a sign of how much pressure they feel to boost their capital levels.Banks have long been reluctant to pay for assets using stock when prices are as low as they are now, and issuing more stock would reduce the value of their shares even more.
