Not only is Comcast the largest U.S. cable company, it is also the top broadband provider. That advantage was not lost on the FCC or Justice Department, who made it clear in approving the deal on Tuesday they were worried about Comcast stifling competition from new online video competitors. As a result, regulators will require that Comcast give up what the Justice Department described as management rights to Hulu, the online video site co-owned by News Corp, Walt Disney Co and NBC Universal.

The only dissenting FCC vote came from Commissioner Michael Copps, who objected to the merger on the grounds it would give Comcast too much power. "The potential for walled gardens, toll booths, content prioritization, access fees to reach end users and a stake in the heart of independent content production is now very real," Copps said in a statement.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp will sacrifice day-to-day control of popular video website Hulu as a condition for regulatory approval of its combination with NBC Universal, clearing the way for the deal to close in the next two weeks.The Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice approved the combination - but with a variety of conditions -- more than a year after the companies announced it.

Company executives said the regulatory conditions would not have any impact on its financial projections. Other key requirements are intended to ensure that Comcast deals fairly with rival cable and satellite providers since it will now be the owner of major content from NBC and its various cable channels. In other words, it will not be able to withhold content it owns like USA or CNBC from a competing pay-TV company.

Put another way, if Apple TV struck deals with CBS or Fox, it would then have the right to distribute NBC shows on similar terms. What is more, Comcast will be required to make stand-alone broadband service available to customers at $49.95 per month for three years. That means it can't force customers to take both its broadband and cable services.
