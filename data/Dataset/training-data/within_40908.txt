Ferguson said more such agreements were likely, including potential for BHP-Billiton. "I expect our uranium exports to China will also grow....The uranium industry is a developing market in Australia."

"I think the ExxonMobil contract indicates that from time to time there are tensions in the diplomatic relationship, but commercial activity goes on," said Ferguson.

"It's a statement about the nature of our two economies and the fact that Australia is important to China, just like China is important to Australia," Ferguson said of the deal. "Australia is a resource- and energy-rich nation, and we have a capacity, if we develop our resources, to meet the economic needs of China." Canberra said U.S. major ExxonMobil Corp signed a deal to sell liquefied natural gas from its share of an LNG project in Australia to PetroChina in a deal worth about A$50 billion ($41.29 billion), the biggest ever trade deal between the two nations.
