This might help a little bit in the near-term, but basically I think we're on the downside of an economic cycle and while this type of move could help, we still have some basic issues to resolve before we can begin a full-fledged recovery. I think it will be some time before the economy starts to turn around.

It will be a question of whether investors will see it as a stimulative move that will help push the economy out of this trough it has fallen into, or whether investors see it as a desperate move on the part of the Fed to stave off recession that is probably likely." "I personally think that the economy has a lot of issues right now with respect to housing, the availability of credit and a slowdown in order rates for different types of business equipment.

"I think that is part of why the Fed went so aggressively. I think they do want to steepen the money market curve because that is particularly beneficial to banks, who borrow overnight and lend out at term. It's sort of a horse race but the Fed would like to get the overnight rate down below at least the two-year rate."

With the Fed being this aggressive the idea is that you'll get Sep/Sep and Dec/Dec pretty steep because the Fed will be sort of done easing in a fast manner. By September we'll have a really low funds rate and then it will be more sort of thinking about when they start hiking again.

However the markets should soon refocus on the question of how quickly interest rate cuts as well as the fiscal package will be able to turn the market around and provide a lasting floor for stabilization. Here, markets were not convinced that this would be possible. That was one of the main features of the last couple of trading days and so most likely the Fed rate cut will only deliver temporary relief.
