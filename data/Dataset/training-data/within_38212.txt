programs as legal," referring to its BOLT program, Nasdaq's FLASH program, and Direct Edge's ELP. Brian Hyndman, Nasdaq OMX's senior vice president of transaction services, told Reuters the exchange wants "a level playing field," adding he thanked Direct Edge for its letter of support. The letters to the SEC come within weeks of a clash on a New York conference panel between NYSE Euronext Executive Vice President Larry Leibowitz and Direct Edge Chief Executive William O'Brien on the topic.

Nasdaq Stock Market parent Nasdaq OMX and BATS Exchange, the other players in the country's cut-throat trading industry, recently applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer similar products. Direct Edge, the No. 3 U.S. equities-trading venue, has made big market share gains in recent months. Big Board parent NYSE Euronext, which retains the biggest market share, last week urged the SEC to reject the Nasdaq and BATS filings on the grounds it "impedes a free and open market system and harms the investing public." NYSE Euronext's May 28 letter also highlighted Direct Edge's product, called the Enhanced Liquidity Provider (ELP), asking the market regulator to "undertake a market-wide review of the impact of such pre-routing display functionality." On Wednesday, Direct Edge said in a letter to the SEC that NYSE Euronext's comments are "factually inaccurate, are logically inconsistent, and contradict their own market structures, prior policy statements, and marketing materials." Direct Edge, which is not yet an exchange but last month matched 12.6 percent of U.S. stock trades, said its ELP product, as well as Nasdaq's and BATS' proposals, "are part of a broader strategic competitive battle regarding the liquidity-aggregation and other innovative products offered to their customers."

In its nine-page letter addressed to SEC Secretary Elizabeth Murphy, Direct Edge also urged the SEC to approve the applications from Nasdaq and BATS. The ELP program has helped Direct Edge more than triple its market share in less than a year. A crackdown on these types of programs could severely crimp the company's growth and revamp the market share of U.S. exchanges.

"It's not a positive trend," Mecane said on the sidelines of an industry conference hosted by Sandler O'Neill here, adding the company is debating whether to file another letter to the SEC to clarify its position.
