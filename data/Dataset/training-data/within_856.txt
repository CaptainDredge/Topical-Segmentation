Equity Office has been the subject of buyout rumors for the past few months as private funds, including Blackstone, have snapped up publicly traded REITs. Blackstone said the cash offer of $48.50 per share -- an 8.5 percent premium to the stock's closing price -- valued Equity Office at nearly $20 billion, including all of the company's securities.

Equity Office's other markets -- like Boston and San Francisco -- have recovered as soon or as quickly. "If you look at EOP's weakest markets, (Blackstone) thinks they've got farther to go than the (stock) market's pricing suggests," Feldman said. "If they're not recovering faster, then they're making a bet that they can hold on to great real estate for a long time if they have to." Unlike publicly traded REITs, private buyers can finance their purchases by using more than 90 percent debt, allowing them to boost the return on their own money they use.
