They are targeted for customers who are looking for a larger notional contract size, BOX said. However, the International Securities Exchange said on Friday it chose not to join BOX in opening them for trading. ISE's primary concern was that this would divide trading between the standard SPY options and the jumbos, therefore weakening the liquidity in one of the most actively traded issues in options.

Its introduction comes at a time when competing exchanges are trying to innovate and meet the demand of their customers. "There are 11 option exchanges competing for order flow and innovation is the lifeblood of their future growth," said Andy Nybo, head of derivatives at research firm TABB Group. BOX received the go-ahead from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this week to trade the Jumbo SPY contract.

Over the past several years, the industry has seen the expansion of trading in weekly options contracts, the introduction of mini-options, listed Treasury options and options with smaller price increments, Nybo said. But ISE's Ilyevsky said those products - including mini-options targeted for retail investors - met specific needs of industry participants.

Other option venues can list the contract after submitting a rule filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Jumbo SPY options are based on 1,000 shares of the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund ( SPY.P ), the largest U.S. ETF by assets, compared to the standard contract based on 100 shares.

For this year through Thursday, volume on the SPY stood at 216.9 million contracts, compared with 199.3 million contracts for the year-ago period, according to the OCC, which clears all U.S.-listed options. BOX said on Friday that it has seen the ISE letter to their members and "respects their position." "We have spoken to other customers that have asked us to list this product and while we are happy to offer this to the marketplace, the market will ultimately dictate if the product is accepted," said Ed Boyle, senior vice president of strategy at BOX.
