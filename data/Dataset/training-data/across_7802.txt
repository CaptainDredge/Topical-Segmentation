BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Sunday the crucial factor in negotiations over a debt-swap plan for Greece was that Athens should by 2020 have a sustainable level of borrowing."This goal must be achieved," he told German public broadcaster ARD. Chief negotiators for Greece's private creditors left Athens on Saturday without a deal on a debt-swap plan that is vital to avert a chaotic default, sources close to the talks told Reuters.

In order to make Greece's debt sustainable in the long term, the IMF has determined that it must be cut to around 120 percent by 2020 and 110 percent by 2022. But there is no guarantee those levels will be sustainable on those dates. As a result, the prospect of a debt writedown has to remain, especially as the euro zone countries, who will soon be responsible for around three quarters of all Greek debt, have said time and again that they will do what is necessary to keep Greece afloat and in the euro zone.

It is corruption, as we will suggest, on a very large scale," Shears said.
