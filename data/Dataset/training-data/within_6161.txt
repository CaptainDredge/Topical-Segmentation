"This type of sporadic action is likely to happen again but it's not because of the unions," Force Ouvriere union official Julien Talvant said. "The situation on the ground is becoming hard to control and any announcement from the management can end up being the straw that breaks the camel's back," he added.

Airbus plans to cut 964 jobs at its Toulouse headquarters plus 2,305 jobs at its Toulouse assembly plants. At Nantes, 295 jobs will go, at Saint-Nazaire 369 and at Meaulte in northern France 192 jobs will disappear, unions said, citing figures given to them in a management briefing. Airbus is splitting the job cuts between its own staff and suppliers and says it will avoid forced redundancies unless its financial situation gets worse.

Keeping a tight lid on the dividend discussions, EADS has scheduled its decisive board meeting for Friday morning in Amsterdam, immediately before the shareholder meeting. Airbus plans to shed up to 10,000 jobs and fully or partially sell six European factories to save money. French unions said the labor climate in the company's factories was becoming difficult for them to manage.

Both the recent announcement of 10,000 Airbus job cuts and the prospect of a dividend are sensitive political topics in France, where both remaining candidates in the country's presidential election oppose a payout to investors this year. Friday's annual general meeting in Amsterdam will be held on the last day of campaigning for the May 6 French run-off between conservative Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist Segolene Royal.
