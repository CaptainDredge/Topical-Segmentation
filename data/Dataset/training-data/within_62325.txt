McDonald's in March put through a 1 percent menu price rise in the United States, where it plans additional increases. Prices in Europe are up by the same amount and the company plans to raise prices in China. When it comes to raising prices, West said McDonald's has an edge because it attracts a higher-income diner than other fast-food chains.

"It's very hard to pass through price increase right now," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Steve West. McDonald's Chief Executive Jim Skinner said customers are getting "pinched everywhere. They should not suffer the same fate at McDonald's." Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said the company would sacrifice some short-term margin to protect long-term growth.

"The bottom line is they're still doing a great job of growing revenue," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments. Analysts remain worried that high gas prices could force fast-food restaurant patrons to cut back. But Jankovskis said McDonald's was better equipped than others to cope. McDonald's has roughly 32,700 restaurants around the world.

The United States alone has 14,000 units, which means customers do not have to travel far to get to one. "The big test will come in the summer months with gasoline remaining in the neighborhood of $4.00 (a gallon) -- that's when the strength of McDonald's will come through," he said.

First-quarter net income rose 10.9 percent to $1.21 billion, or $1.15 per share, topping analysts' profit view by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total first-quarter revenue at the Golden Arches rose 9 percent to $6.1 billion, with sales in Europe leading the way. Still, operating margin fell to 17.7 percent from 18.2 percent as costs for food and paper rose.
