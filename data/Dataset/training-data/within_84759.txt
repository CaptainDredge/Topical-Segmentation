(Reuters) - The parent of American Airlines on Friday renewed its push to void its collective bargaining agreement with its pilots' union, two days after a federal bankruptcy judge rejected an earlier effort.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan, who oversees the Chapter 11 proceedings of American Airlines' parent AMR Corp ( AAMRQ.PK ), had objected to what he called the carrier's proposed "unfettered discretion" under its earlier proposal to temporarily lay off pilots and engage in code-sharing.

The new code-sharing proposal would let AMR enter new relationships with other U.S. carriers and their regional partners, subject to limits based on seating and miles traveled. It also would allow restricted code-sharing relationships with Alaska Air Group Inc's ( ALK.N ) Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Holdings Inc's ( HA.O ) Hawaiian Airlines.

To rush this process doesn't behoove either party." A hearing on the revised plan is scheduled for September 4. Lane's decision on Wednesday was unexpected and set back Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR in its effort to save more than $1 billion a year in labor costs, including $315 million from the pilots union.

AMR said its revised plan addresses these concerns by retaining current contractual limits on furloughs and setting restrictions on the ability of the third-largest U.S. airline to enter code-sharing relationships. "We believe both of those changes properly address the court's concern," and will help AMR "keep moving forward to achieve the savings and flexibility needed for our successful restructuring," AMR spokesman Bruce Hicks said in a statement.

AMR's flight attendants union is scheduled on Sunday to finish voting on their own final contract offer from management. The carrier has already reached consensual labor terms with the Transport Workers Union, which represents ground workers. The case is In re AMR Corp et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-15463.
