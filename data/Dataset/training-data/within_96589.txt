Commentary: Yahoo: COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC PARTNERS "The stock bounced all around. It went up on the earnings numbers and now it's down because people are looking at it a little more closely and realizing that its core business is showing signs of weakness, particularly in display ad revenue that declined 11 percent.

"People were disappointed by the display advertising because that's Yahoo's key business. We were looking for display to be down about 9 percent, and they came in at negative 11.

"People may be surprised by the fact that datacenter was down quarter on quarter more than the PC client group. The market really wants to see how they can help customers win in the marketplace. The thinking is that it has to be price, but I don't think that is driving the market.
