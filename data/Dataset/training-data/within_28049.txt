Istvan Zsoldos, analyst at Goldman Sachs in London: "Potentially this (package) could be on the large side, considering the Ukraine deal. It would probably boost sentiment in the short term." "There is a potential self-fulfilling element in all of these crises, because sentiment deteriorates, which induces further capital outflow, making financing even more difficult." "The IMF package would be an important tool to combat this self-fulfilling spiral." JPMorgan's Nora Szentivanyi in a note dated October 24: "The IMF has also agreed to provide help if needed, and we estimate that Hungary could borrow up to $12 billion from the fund under the supplementary reserve facility.
