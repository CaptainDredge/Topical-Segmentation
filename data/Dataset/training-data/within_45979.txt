ZURICH/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A client of Swiss bank UBS won an appeal to prevent her account data from being given to the United States as part of a U.S. probe into possible tax evasion among wealthy bank customers.The case raises doubt about the future of the effort to identify U.S. citizens who might have hidden billions of dollars in UBS bank accounts to avoid taxes.

Swiss financial watchdog FINMA has appealed against a court ruling that it broke Swiss law last year when it ordered UBS to hand over tax-sensitive data of nearly 300 clients to U.S. authorities in an unconnected case. FINMA's decision was a prelude to the Swiss government bowing to international pressure on tax havens and agreeing to soften its cherished bank secrecy laws in March, a competitive advantage for the Alpine country's banks.

"The Swiss courts are now one-upping the U.S.," said Bryan Skarlatos, an attorney for wealthy clients, many of whom have sought amnesty with the IRS. "The question is, how will the UBS commitment to turn over 4,450 names be fulfilled if these types of taxpayers cannot be turned over under the treaty." U.S. tax authorities said they expect Switzerland to honor the deal, which strained relations between the countries last year.

Switzerland's laws give bank account holders protection against outside scrutiny, and UBS's agreement to give names to the United States was a notable departure from that tradition. A Swiss administrative court ruled on Friday that an agreement on double taxation with the United States only allows for data to be disclosed in cases of "fraud or the like." The decision means that the United States might not get details that it wants on 4,450 UBS clients, lawyers said.

Many have turned themselves in under the IRS's voluntary disclosure program. Most of the people whose accounts would be handed over to the United States were suspected of fraud, not simple tax evasion, the Swiss justice department said in November. The department said it would give the names of American UBS clients with accounts holding more than 1 million Swiss francs ($986,200) where there was reasonable suspicion of tax fraud.
