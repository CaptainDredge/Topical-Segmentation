BERNE  (Reuters) - The Swiss government said it was sure it could resolve a legal impasse threatening a deal struck by the U.S. and bank UBS to hand over data on clients the U.S. suspects of dodging taxes.A Swiss court last week ruled in favor of a UBS client seeking to prevent her account data from being given to the U.S. tax agency, throwing doubt on Switzerland's ability to deliver details of 4,450 UBS client accounts as agreed in August.

UBS, which posts full-year results on February 9, had hoped the August deal would give it a fresh start, enabling it to rebuild its reputation and stem a torrent of client withdrawals. "I don't see this as a trigger for more net new money outflows to be more than was already expected," said Vontobel analyst Teresa Nielsen.

UBS welcomed the government's decision to seek dialogue with the U.S. and said it would support the search for a solution. "As before, we will fulfill all our commitments under the agreement," UBS said in a written statement. LEGAL RISK If the Swiss government fails to find a solution, the Swiss court ruling could prompt U.S. officials to go back to the federal court in Miami to enforce its original summons request, a so-called John Doe summons that seeks unidentified defendants that meet certain criteria without naming them.

The Swiss government said one possible way to resolve the problems thrown up by Friday's ruling would be to seek retroactive approval for the UBS deal from the Swiss parliament, which the court itself had indicated as a possible solution. The United States has said it would withdraw its summons seeking client names if it got 10,000 UBS account holder names voluntarily, which could possibly make Friday's court ruling irrelevant.

Widmer-Schlumpf said the 4,450 client accounts sought by the U.S. also needed to be among the 10,000 overall disclosures. The Swiss government would press for detailed information on the amnesty program, which had been extremely successful, she added. U.S. authorities have not revealed how many of the 14,700 names gathered in a U.S. tax amnesty program were UBS clients, increasing the pressure on the Swiss government to find a way to hand over the requested data as agreed.
