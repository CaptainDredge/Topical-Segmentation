They can not base this evaluation on teaser rates that will later rise -- So-called "low-doc, no-doc" loans - in which lenders make quick, risky sales, then flip the loans to investors - will not be permitted -- Creditors refinancing non-prime mortgages into a more stable loan would not need to follow the full underwriting process QUALIFIED MORTGAGE -- Loans that meet certain requirements will be considered compliant with the ability-to-repay rule -- Points and fees paid by consumers for these loans cannot exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount -- Terms of more than 30 years, interest-only loans and other risky features are not allowed -- Borrowers must have a debt-to-income ratio of no more than 43 percent -- For a temporary period, mortgages extended to borrowers who do not meet the debt-to-income requirement could be considered "qualified" if they meet standards laid out by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or other U.S. government housing programs -- Regulators are accepting comments on a proposal to offer "qualified" status to certain loans made by community banks and credit unions LEGAL PROTECTION -- Lower-priced loans that are considered "qualified" would give lenders a higher level of protection against lawsuits known as a "safe harbor" -- Higher-priced loans that count as "qualified" trigger a legal protection known as "rebuttable presumption." Under this standard, a borrower could sue a lender if they could show that after all of the costs associated with the loan, they did not have enough money remaining for living expenses -- Neither of these legal standards prevents borrowers from suing lenders who break other consumer protection laws (Reporting by  Emily Stephenson  and  Margaret Chadbourn ; Editing by  Lisa Shumaker )
