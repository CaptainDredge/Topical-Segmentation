The defendants were among eight former Marsh executives indicted in September 2005 as part of a price-fixing probe conducted by Eliot Spitzer, then the attorney general of New York. Spitzer accused the executives of colluding with American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), units of Ace Ltd ( ACE.N ) and Zurich Financial Services AG ( ZURN.VX ), Liberty International Insurance Co and other companies to rig the market for excess casualty insurance from November 1998 to September 2004.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Three former Marsh Inc executives were acquitted on Monday of criminal charges in a bid-rigging and price-fixing scheme in which they were accused of colluding to steer clients to favored insurers.Joseph Peiser, who led Marsh's excess casualty unit, and brokerage executives Greg Doherty and Kathleen Drake were found not guilty by Justice James Yates of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan of scheming to defraud and antitrust charges, lawyers for Peiser and Drake said.

The indictments came after Marsh's parent, New York-based Marsh & McLennan Cos ( MMC.N ), agreed in January 2005 to pay $850 million to settle related civil charges by Spitzer. Marsh & McLennan did not face criminal sanctions, and did not admit wrongdoing in settling the civil charges. Peiser and Drake were managing directors at Marsh, while Doherty was a senior vice president, Spitzer had said.

She thought she hadn't done anything wrong, and that the verdict is what would happen." A spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, whose office took over the case, did not immediately return a call for comment. A lawyer for Doherty did not immediately return a call for comment. Yates in February 2008 found two other former Marsh managing directors, William Gilman and Edward McNenney, guilty on an antitrust charge in the case, though they were acquitted on other charges.
