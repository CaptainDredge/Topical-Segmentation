The VIX rose 10 percent to 23.44, ending the trading session above its 200-day moving average of 23.20. "Today's sell-off came amid mixed earnings news and uninspiring economic data early," said option strategist Frederic Ruffy at Web information site WhatsTrading.com. The sell-off, led by banks and brokerages, began in earnest after data from the National Association of Realtors showed June sales of existing homes hit a 10-year low.

Interactive Brokers Group analyst Rebecca Engmann Darst noticed some unusual call activity in the SKF. It looked like a trader entered a 2,000-lot call spread in the January contract between strikes $130 and $200 in a trade that suggested the view that financial stocks would continue to decline through the fall and that the July 15 high of $204.27 will remain into 2009, Darst said.

In the options market, investors often turn to calls in the fund if they are bearish on the financial sector and anticipate its shares to go higher. According to option analytics firm Trade Alert, about 39,000 calls changed hands vs. 11,000 puts, suggesting some traders may be using the fund to protect their positions in the financial space, an analyst said.
