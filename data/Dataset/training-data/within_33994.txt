LONDON  (Reuters) - Property investments and leveraged finance deals played a big part in the downfall of HBOS, its results showed on Friday.HBOS's corporate division grew rapidly when the UK economy boomed, targeting leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and property investments, however many of those deals have since soured. Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ), the part-nationalized bank that bought HBOS last month, said HBOS made a 10.8 billion pound ($15.33 billion) loss in 2008, largely because of a 7 billion pound loss in the corporate division, headed by Peter Cummings.

Lloyds, which is in talks with the UK government to park many of its most toxic debts in a government-backed insurance scheme, has said it has applied more conservative provisioning to HBOS's assets. It acknowledged HBOS's risk profile had compounded the economic downturn. "The shape of the corporate book, and in particular its exposure to housebuilders, risk capital (loan stock, preference shares and ordinary shares) and large single credit exposures, exacerbated the impact," Lloyds said.

Lloyds' Chief Executive Eric Daniels said on Friday Lloyds was "basically stopping" its integrated finance business, as well as a number of other high-risk operations. Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) said on Thursday it is quitting leveraged and project financing, as well as real estate financing, as part of an investment banking retreat.

Many of its investments have been hit by the collapse in appetite for risky loans and property. Retirement home builder McCarthy & Stone on Friday said its senior lenders, including HBOS, had taken control of the company via a debt-for-equity swap. HBOS led a syndicate of banks providing more than 1 billion pounds of debt to back McCarthy & Stone's acquisition in 2006 by a consortium including Tom Hunter's West Coast Capital.

The LBO portfolio was diversified, however it was suffering from declining credit quality, the bank said. Impairment provisions rose to 370 million pounds for 2008 from 34 million in 2007. Seeking private equity style returns, HBOS invested directly in borrowers via its integrated finance division. Over a decade the division invested in more than 130 companies and many delivered big profits when the economy performed strongly.
