But days later, Wells Fargo signed an agreement to buy all of Wachovia for about $15 billion at the time, including its asset management and retail brokerage arms. The recent slide in Wells Fargo shares puts the value closer to $12 billion, based on Thursday's closing price. CONCERNS REMAIN If Citi pursues the $60 billion legal battle against Wells Fargo and Wachovia for "breach of contract and tortious interference," the company could face some turmoil in the coming periods, RBC said.

"It (the Wachovia deal) provides Wells Fargo with the opportunity to become a national banking franchise at a much lower cost than cobbling several one-off transactions together," Stifel analyst Christopher Mutascio said in a note to clients. The low cost of the acquisition and the tax benefits from it could allow the company to "manufacture earnings" that other banks can not do, in a more prolonged and broader-based economic downturn than originally anticipated, Mutascio said.

Marquardt said the deal is a "great" one for Wells Fargo as Wachovia has a strong legacy in retail, commercial and corporate banking, asset management and retail brokerage in the Southeast region. Citigroup agreed last week to buy Wachovia's banking assets for about $2.2 billion, with partial government assistance, and it financially supported Wachovia while they hammered out final details.

Citigroup ( C.N ) on Thursday walked away from its brief but acrimonious battle with Wells Fargo over Wachovia, losing out on a deal crucial to strengthening its retail banking business but vowing to pursue up to $60 billion in legal claims. CONFUSION OVER "This removes any confusion regarding how a potential breakup of Wachovia franchise to appease Citi and government might have worked in terms of logistics, legalities, and financials," Fox-Pitt analyst Andrew Marquardt said.

"Due to a provision in section 126(c) of the recently-passed bailout bill, however, Wells may be free of liability, but if not it may still have an option to back out of the deal due to a material adverse change," RBC analyst Joe Morford said. The company's proposed $20 billion equity offering may also be more dilutive now that bank stocks have sold off significantly since the deal was announced, Morford said.
