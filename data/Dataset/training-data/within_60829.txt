"In our base scenario (a), we estimate that real GDP will contract in the second-quarter, but return to 2 percent growth in the third quarter, once the impact of power outages disappears. Real GDP is pushed down around 0.5 percent in this case. "In the event power outages are prolonged however, such as cases (b) and (c), we estimate a 2 percent contraction in real GDP in 2Q; and if they were to last until end-December (case c), we estimate GDP would continue declining until the year-end." SOCIETE GENERALE Economic impact: * Economic losses of around 10 trillion yen, or 2 percent of GDP.

Fiscal measures responding to the damages will amount to 1-5 trillion yen, or 0.2-1 percent of GDP Comment: "Any disaster will diminish the value of assets and is never positive for the economy. The disruption caused by a disaster usually results in lower economic output in that particular month or quarter.

"As a rough estimate, looking back at past disasters, our team in Tokyo expects GDP to drop roughly 0.5 percentage points over the full year relative to their baseline of 1.5 percent. However, the drop is short-lived: they expect a surge in reconstruction to add to growth in the second half and in 2012." JP MORGAN Economic impact: * The bank cut its Q1 and Q2 growth forecasts for Japan's economy to 1.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively, from previous growth forecasts of 2.2 percent in each quarter; in Q3 and Q4, estimates were raised to 4.0 percent and 2.5 percent from 2.5 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively * Full-year growth in 2011 was revised down to 1.4 percent from 1.7 percent; 2012 growth estimate revised up to 2.0 percent from 1.8 percent Comment: "The economic cost of the disaster will be large.

However, we now think July-September or possibly October-December is more likely. We expect solid economic recovery to be confirmed in October-December." STANDARD CHARTERED BANK Economic impact: * Rebuilding costs to be at least 1 percent of GDP * Likely to see negative GDP growth in the first quarter Comment: "Provided that the authorities can successfully contain a nuclear-plant crisis, we now expect most economic activity to take a substantial hit in March/April but to rebound in the following months.

"The big uncertainty about this disaster (and what sets it apart from other such disasters) is that roughly 10 percent of electricity generation capacity (both nuclear and coal) may be off line for a few months, until oil- and gas-fired plants can ramp up. In the near-term, this could have major negative ramifications for the Japanese industrial sectors; some steel and automotive factories have already been closed." CREDIT SUISSE Economic impact: * Total economic losses could be 14-15 trillion yen, less than half that of the 1995 Kobe earthquake; recovery could cost 4-5 trillion over next three years * Initial disaster relief could cost 2 trillion yen, mostly funded from contingency reserves so only limited need to increase Japanese government bond issuance * Cuts 2011 growth rate estimate by 0.2 percentage points but sees a "decent risk" of 0.5-1.0 percentage point hit to Japanese growth this year CITIGROUP Economic impact: * 5-10 trillion yen (up to $122 billion) in damage to housing and infrastructure * Growth to be slower than previously forecast in H1, but faster in H2 because of reconstruction * 2011 GDP growth forecast: 1.7 pct (unchanged) * 2012 GDP growth forecast: 2.3 pct (up from 1.9 pct) Comment: "It may be too early to discuss how much damage was done to housing and infrastructure, but we suspect it could match that of the Great Hanshin Earthquake in 1995.
