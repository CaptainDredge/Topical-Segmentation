Buying and integrating companies like Scottish equity investment firm Walter Scott & Partners four years ago also got O'Hanley noticed by Fidelity Investments -- his much more prominent Boston-based neighbor where he will soon head the privately owned company's asset management and corporate services. Fidelity oversees $1.5 trillion in assets. "Ron O'Hanley may have managed money himself years ago but foremost he is known as a good manager of people," said Geoff Bobroff, an industry consultant in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, "and that will be an important skill in returning Fidelity to its position as dominant player in domestic equity funds." As speculation mounted in Boston over who may ultimately replace Fidelity's 79-year-old Chairman Edward "Ned" Johnson, the short list included industry stars who have worked in government and hopscotched between Wall Street's biggest firms.

Both men preferred brightly colored shirts with French cuffs while O'Hanley sticks to more muted colors and thick dark-rimmed eyeglasses. But his qualifications are top notch. Like Johnson's daughter Abigail, who will run another major division of the company, O'Hanley earned a business degree from Harvard. Both O'Hanley and Abigail Johnson will report to Edward Johnson.

Last year, O'Hanley's total compensation was over $7.8 million, paid chiefly in the form of a $2.9 million bonus, restricted stock awards and options, earning him far less than many Wall Street executives. People who know him say O'Hanley is anything but flashy, possibly setting a different tone from the two men who preceded him at Fidelity -- Rodger Lawson, Fidelity's former No. 2 who retired in March and Robert Reynolds, who now runs Putnam Investments.

O'Hanley's name was not mentioned. O'Hanley, who is a vice chairman at BNY Mellon and has been with Mellon Financial Corp since 1997, was not mentioned publicly by those speculating who might be tapped for a job. But O'Hanley's calm and low-key demeanor -- which prompted his current boss, BNY Mellon chief Robert Kelly, to praise him as one of the best in the industry -- may have won over the Johnson family where the patriarch is known to prefer well-worn shoes, sometimes with visible holes.

BOSTON  (Reuters) - For years Ronald O'Hanley has earned praise in the mutual fund industry for skillfully knitting together smaller asset managers into a powerhouse unit with more than $1 trillion in assets at BNY Mellon Corp.Indeed the acquisitions the 53-year-old stitched together as head of BNY Mellon's asset management unit quickly catapulted the unit into the small and exclusive club of managers who oversee the bulk of Americans' retirement and college savings.
