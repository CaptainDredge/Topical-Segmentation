CIBC World Markets analyst Bret Holley dropped his Amgen 12 to 18-month price target to $65 from $72, saying he expects the shares to settle in the low-to-mid $50s near-term. But Holley said positive data from a promising experimental osteoporosis drug and potential delays in getting to market by a competing anemia drug from Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) could "help offset this overhang." Bucking the bearish trend, A.G. Edwards and Deutsche Bank maintained "buy" ratings on Amgen shares.

The products are man-made forms of the natural protein, erythropoietin, or Epo for short, used to increase red blood cells to combat anemia caused by chemotherapy and in patients with kidney failure. There has been some fear in the medical community that the drugs could be feeding growth of certain tumor types, although the panel members endorsed their continued use in preventing the need for blood transfusions.

Several other industry analysts cut ratings on Amgen's stock, including HSBC to "neutral" from "overweight," Morgan Stanley to "equalweight" from "overweight" and JP Morgan to "neutral" from "overweight." Jefferies & Co. analyst Adam Walsh cut his price target on the stock to $55 from $64 and lowered Aranesp sales projections every year through 2011, when he cut his forecast by 23 percent to $3.8 billion.

The panel also recommended tightening the marketing of the drugs and called for more studies to be conducted. "The meeting's outcome matched our worst fears about the risk for a potential unexpectedly bad outcome," Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a research note. "We had not anticipated that the committee and the FDA could challenge the current use in so many ways and directions," said Porges, who estimated that, if the drugs were to be banned for use by people with breast cancer, it could eliminate 19 percent of Aranesp patients and 16 percent of Procrit patients.

The cloud that got darker in March, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added new warnings to the drugs' labels, turned black on Thursday when the advisory panel came down hard on the marketing and use of the anemia drugs that had combined sales of $10 billion last year. "The panel discussing the use of (the anemia drugs) in oncology was much harsher than we expected, recommending further tightening beyond the restrictions the FDA recently invoked," Lazard analyst Joel Sendek wrote in a research note in which he took his rating on Amgen shares all the way down to a "sell" from "buy." Sendek forecast a 21 percent decrease in worldwide Aranesp sales this year and significantly lowered his earnings per share projections through 2010, taking his 2007 EPS forecast down to $4.09 from $4.30 and 2010 to $4.80 from $5.77.
