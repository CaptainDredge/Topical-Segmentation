SINGAPORE/BEIJING  (Reuters) - Inflation remains a major challenge and tighter monetary policies are needed across East Asia, the World Bank said on Monday, as it downplayed risks to regional growth from the devastating earthquake in Japan.In a semi-annual East Asia and Pacific Economic Update, the World Bank nudged up its 2011 growth forecasts, but said the big picture was that the fight against inflation would weigh on economies from China to Malaysia.

China, the world's second-largest economy, is likely to grow 9.0 percent this year, slower than last year's 10.3 percent pace, it added. JAPAN WARNINGS Not everyone agreed with the World Bank's relatively sanguine outlook on Japan's ability to recover. Speaking at a forum in Singapore, the country's Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said Japan's nuclear crisis could hurt consumer and business confidence.

"I also know the authorities are doing a lot in cooling asset prices by making targeted action toward asset markets in particular areas, and that is also to be welcomed." Excluding China, developing East Asia will probably expand 5.3 percent this year, down from a 6.7 percent expansion last year, the report said.

TIGHTER POLICY NEEDED The World Bank predicted that the developing nations of East Asia will grow 8.2 percent in 2011, faster than the 7.8 percent forecast it made six months earlier, but a clear deceleration from the region's estimated 9.6 percent growth in 2010. It warned that central banks in the region risk falling behind the curve in combating price pressures if they do not raise interest rates and let their currencies rise.

The U.S. bank said risks to growth appear greatest in Thailand, where manufacturers rely on electronics, car and chemical components from Japan. South Korea and Taiwan also turn to Japan for plastic and electronic components, but both also compete with Japan in many areas and may benefit from higher prices and market share gains.
