The shares of the Sun -- whose name was once synonymous with the Internet, but never recovered from a dive in sales after the dot.com bubble burst -- have lost 97 percent of their value since peaking at $260 in 2000.

But she added the challenge would be to integrate the two cultures and product lines. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that IBM was in the final stages of negotiations with Sun, but had reduced its offer from $10 to $11. Last month, the newspaper reported the deal was worth about $8 billion, including $1.4 billion in cash on Sun's balance sheet, if IBM were to pay $10 to $11 per share.

IBM shares held steady in extended trading after gaining more than 3 percent. Sun rose to prominence in the 1990s, but after the dot.com bubble burst earlier this decade, it failed to generate substantial profit from software products, including Java and Solaris. To counteract a potential slide in margins after a deal is completed, IBM is likely to embark on a major reorganization that could produce more job losses at a company known for talented engineers and a heavy focus on research and development.

Sun agreed to a lower price in return for stronger commitments from IBM that it will complete the deal, even if it faces intense regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying. Sun would hand IBM a clear lead at the high end of the $45 billion overall server market fought over with Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ).
