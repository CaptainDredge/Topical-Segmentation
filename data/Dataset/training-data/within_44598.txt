GE has been working on the three-way deal, which values NBC Universal at $30 billion, since March. French media company Vivendi SA, which had owned a 20 percent stake in the operation, agreed to sell its holding for $5.8 billion, which cleared the way for the GE-Comcast joint venture. GE shares were up 16 cents at $16.23 on the New York Stock Exchange.

"We believe there are going to be multiple investment opportunities with attractive returns." Investors reacted warmly to the idea of GE focusing in on its core businesses, and one warned that he expects the company to tread cautiously as it decides how to redeploy capital. "Let's not get too cavalier with that cash," said Peter Sorrentino, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which owns GE shares.

BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co's sale of a majority stake in its NBC Universal media arm to Comcast Corp marks a big step forward in what could be a time of significant restructuring at the largest U.S. conglomerate.The long-expected sale of the media business, which accounted for about 10 percent of GE revenue, focuses the world's biggest maker of jet engines and electricity-generating turbines more tightly on its core business of selling heavy equipment and financing the purchase of it.

GE has done a steady stream of deals since Immelt took the helm in 2001, buying businesses worth about $279 billion and selling some $78 billion in operations -- before the NBC deal. EASING CAPITAL CONCERNS The proceeds of the NBC deal should also help to ease Wall Street's concerns about whether GE Capital -- which has invested heavily in the now-slumping commercial real estate market -- will require additional cash.

The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company will receive about $8 billion in cash when the deal closes and gets the option to cash in the rest of its 49 percent stake in NBC Universal over seven years. "We have the opportunity to redeploy $8 billion in cash back into a high-returning global infrastructure business," GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on a conference call.
