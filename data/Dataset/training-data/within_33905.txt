Obama, a Democrat, said "painful experience" showed the rules needed to be modernized. The economy cannot sustain "21st century markets with 20th century regulations," Obama told reporters after the meeting with lawmakers. "If we once again guide the market's invisible hand with a higher principle, our markets will recover, our economy will once again thrive and America will once again lead the world in this new century as it did in the last," he said.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama called on Wednesday for a sweeping overhaul of Wall Street regulations, saying big changes were needed to avoid a repeat of the financial meltdown.Obama convened a high-level White House meeting on the issue that included Democratic and Republican lawmakers who said they would work with the administration to craft legislation in the next few weeks.

The European Union is also stepping up the pace of financial regulation reform. The executive European Commission published guidelines on Wednesday for an EU-wide approach to dealing with toxic assets at banks and a report to be debated by EU leaders called for two bodies to coordinate oversight of financial institutions across Europe.

Obama said the need for regulatory reform was a global one. "We must recognize that the challenges we face are not just American challenges, they are global challenges," he said. Well before the mid-September collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a meltdown in the financial markets, Obama had urged a wide-ranging overhaul of the patchwork system of Wall Street regulatory agencies.

Obama wants to signal that the United States has no intention of dragging its feet on the effort. The G20 -- comprised of the United States and major European economies as well as fast-growing economies like China -- is looking at how to reshape the financial regulatory system that was largely shaped toward the end of World War Two at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference.
