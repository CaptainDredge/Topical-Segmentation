For now, that most strongly affects American companies that compete with state-owned enterprises or state-supported enterprises in their home market. "But as SOEs and SSEs grow, they are increasingly competing in third markets abroad and they are beginning to compete in the U.S. market," the U.S. business groups said. A "MULTITUDE OF ADVANTAGES" Vice President Joe Biden is expected to raise U.S. concerns about China's state-owned enterprises during talks this week in Beijing with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, China's presumed future leader, and with Hu. The United States believes China should "dismantle a set of financial controls that tend to channel cheaper credit to state-owned enterprises," putting their own private companies and foreign competitors at a disadvantage, U.S. Treasury Under Secretary Lael Brainard told reporters on Monday.

But a glance back at the 2005 list would give Hu more of a reason to smile. That year China had just 16 companies in the top 500 and the United States had 176, including at least one, Lehman Brothers, no longer around.

HOPES PINNED ON TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP TALKS U.S. business groups support the OECD effort, even though China is not yet a member of the 50-year-old group.

"A new dynamic in the world economy threatens the competitiveness of American companies and workers in world markets and undermines our country's core belief in market-based economy," the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Coalition of Services Industries said in a joint report. "No adequate and effective international disciplines now exist to deal with this problem," the groups added, complaining that China and other countries lavish regulatory favors and generous subsidies on their state-owned firms.
