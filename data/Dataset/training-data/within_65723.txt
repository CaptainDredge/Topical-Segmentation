The banks involved in the HSBC deal have had many questions about which loans will be combined with the branches, sources said. HSBC corporate clients whose loans are not sold, and who are therefore staying with HSBC, may not be interested in depositing their money in a branch belonging to another bank, sources said.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ) are among the bidders for HSBC Holdings Plc's ( HSBA.L ) U.S. credit card portfolio, according to sources familiar with the situation.In a separate HSBC asset sale, U.S. regional banks First Niagara Financial Group ( FNFG.O ), KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), and M&T Bank Corp ( MTB.N ) are among the bidders for the bank's upstate New York branches, sources said.

"They would own Buffalo at that point. It would be ridiculous. M&T would need to make major divestitures if they won," said Ken Thomas, a consultant who works with banks looking to buy branches. But one banker not involved in the deal waved off these concerns, noting that the buyer could sell branches to appease regulators the way PNC Financial Services Group ( PNC.N ) did when it took over National City.

The asset sales are part of HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver's plan to turn around Europe's largest bank by focusing on its main businesses. HSBC has been criticized for "planting flags" around the world with little consideration to profitability. The bank said in May it may sell the U.S. credit card unit, which has more than $30 billion in assets.

Representatives of Capital One, First Niagara, KeyCorp, M&T, and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment. An HSBC spokesman said its asset review is ongoing, and the bank will communicate key milestones when they occur. ANTITRUST Antitrust matters are a big hurdle for some bidders in the branch sale, because many markets in New York are already dominated by just a few players.
