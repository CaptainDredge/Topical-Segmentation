Lockheed warned investors last month that it faced a potential termination liability of $1.1 billion on that sixth batch of planes, unless it received additional funding by year end. Lockheed received some initial "long-lead" funding for advanced procurement of materials for the planes, but that money ran out a while ago.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) and the Defense Department are nearing agreement on a long-delayed contract for a fifth batch of F-35 fighter jets, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer told Reuters on Wednesday."I think we're getting close," Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall told Reuters after a speech to an investor conference hosted by Credit Suisse.

Hewson told analysts earlier this month that the F-35 program would be one of her top priorities in her new job. "We won't miss a beat on F-35," she said at the time. Hewson is due to speak at the Credit Suisse conference on Thursday. Agreement on the terms would free up additional funding for early work on a sixth set of planes, which the company has been funding on its own for some time.

"The two sides have been arguing over what the plane should cost for the better part of a year. It appears they have now agreed on a price that is midway between their original goals, which means a significant reduction in the cost of each plane from the previous contract," said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Lockheed.
