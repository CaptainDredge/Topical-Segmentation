Nothing good could have come from smart devices as there were no new products." "The fourth quarter will be tough for everybody in mature markets as you will not see the typical hype around smartphones. The hype this year will be about tablets." PETE CUNNINGHAM, CANALYS "We expected that Nokia's third quarter was going to be tough for its smartphone business due to the announcement of Windows Phone 8, however this is worse than expected." "The fourth quarter will be a tough one as it will take a couple of quarters to ramp up Windows Phone 8 volumes due to the competitive landscape." GREGER JOHANSSON, REDEYE "Looking at the Q3 figures, Mobile Phones was as expected while Networks actually came in quite a bit better, both in terms of margin and sales, so that is positive." "On the other hand, I saw that the guiding for the fourth quarter was pretty broad in terms of results, which could be interpreted quite negatively."

The cash-burn rate for the company is tolerable and totally understandable taking into account Nokia's situation." NEIL MAWSTON, STRATEGY ANALYTICS "It looks like feature phone numbers were above expectations slightly, but the smartphone numbers are quite a bit below. It's likely that other vendors like HTC or Sony or RIM may have overtaken Nokia in smartphones, though that is not confirmed yet." "While their smartphone division is struggling their feature phone division is doing okay, but feature phones are a sunset technology and smartphones are sun rising, so they need to transfer growth to the sun rising technology." CAROLINA MILANESI, GARTNER "Mobile phones were good, but this was the only place to look for a good news.
