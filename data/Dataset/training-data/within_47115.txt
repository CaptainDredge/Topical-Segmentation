Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, skirted the question whether the Volcker rule would effectively force banks onto a more responsible course of action in future. "The Volcker rule might be appropriate," Bernanke said, but warned of the need to ensure it didn't inappropriately impinge on banks' ability to manage risk.

Obama, speaking to the Business Roundtable, a lobby group for top executives including Wall Street titans, sought to defuse some opposition to reform that he claimed was grounded in a misrepresentation of administration objectives. "We have arrived at a juncture in our politics where reasonable efforts to update our regulations, or make basic investments in our future, are too often greeted with cries of 'government takeover' or even 'socialism,'" Obama said, adding he was "an ardent believer in the free market." The House of Representatives already has passed a regulatory reform bill that would to rein in risky practices by financial firms blamed for driving the U.S. economy into severe recession in 2007 and triggering a global downturn.

"I won't state any timetable at all; we'll get something soon," he said. There are a number of areas in which compromises must be achieved to get a Senate bill. The Obama administration insists a Consumer Financial Protection Agency is needed -- separate from banking regulators -- to ensure that consumers are not victimized on mortgages, credit cards and other financial instruments, but Republicans are wary about a new bureaucracy.

The bill passed by the House would allow, but not require, regulators to restrict proprietary trading at firms seen as a risk to the financial system's stability. Something similar might be incorporated into the Senate bill. Obama, who had proposed the proprietary trading ban in January, dubbed it "the Volcker rule" in honor after Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who favors separating banks' riskier trading from their less-volatile commercial banking activities and is now head of a panel that advises the White House on economic issues.
