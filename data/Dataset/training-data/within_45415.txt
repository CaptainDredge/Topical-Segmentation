Prosecutors said that while the indictment in December "alleged that Rajaratnam was responsible for illicit profits of $17 million, at this time the government believes that the total illicit gains attributable to Rajaratnam's illegal trading are at least approximately $36 million." The memorandum went on to say that the government plans to file a superseding indictment "that will expand the charges set forth against Rajaratnam in the current indictment." It said those would include insider trading between March and July 2006 over an acquisition of ATI Technologies Inc by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

It said the information came from an unidentified source "to whom Rajaratnam began making large payments in exchange for inside information in or about 2004." Rajaratnam's lawyer, John Dowd, said in a statement: "An analyst's prediction that AMD would acquire ATI was widely reported in the press more than seven weeks before the acquisition was announced." Prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney said in the memorandum to U.S. District Court Judge Richard Holwell that "these changed circumstances militate in favor of detaining Rajaratnam rather than easing his bail conditions." A hearing is scheduled for Friday on bail.
