As hopes have grown that European leaders are getting a grip on the crisis, the franc has weakened, lifting pressure on the central bank, which has spent hundreds of billions of francs in recent months intervening to keep a lid on the currency. After its quarterly policy meeting, the bank reiterated it was sticking with the 1.20 cap while its forecasts suggested the economy was still weakening.

Data out on Thursday showed Swiss producer and import prices eased 0.1 percent in August from a year earlier but rose 0.5 percent on the month, driven by an increase in the cost of oil, chemicals and pharmaceutical products. The SNB kept its target range for the three-month Libor at 0.00-0.25 percent, as analysts polled by Reuters all expected.

The SNB trimmed its inflation forecast to show prices rising just 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent in 2013 and 2014 respectively, far below its 2 percent target. The Swiss economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter, and Jordan said that contraction, along with weak growth in Europe and slowing momentum in emerging markets had prompted the SNB to cut its growth outlook.

"They will stick to the lower band as strongly as they've stuck to it. It's still too high a risk to go towards 1.25," said Sarasin economist Jan Poser. Jordan said in May that the government has drawn up emergency plans - including capital controls - in case the euro collapses, although he said he did not expect that to happen.

"Global risks were highlighted as opposed to mainly euro zone ones," Nikola Stephan of Informa Global Markets said. "So overall, depending on how the situation plays out in the next couple of months, the SNB may consider minor tweaking of policy in December." "FURTHER MEASURES" UNLIKELY Over the past year, trade unions and some exporters have urged the SNB to weaken the franc further, towards 1.40, but those calls have died down as the economy has held up fairly well and given the hefty SNB interventions to defend 1.20.
