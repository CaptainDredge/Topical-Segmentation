Obama seems to want to go all the way toward a complete break-up, and this move must make it more likely that Europe and the G20 will follow this line." HELVEA BANKING ANALYST PETER THORNE: "The really interesting thing is what Europe is going to do, and I can only think they will copy Obama." "These measures are not going to be restricted to the U.S., the anger that Obama and others have expressed is reflected in Europe." NOMURA ANALYST RAUL SINHA: "New regulations are being proposed thick and fast and the industry faces major uncertainty from these." SIMON WILLIS, ANALYST AT NCB STOCKBROKERS: "Obama's proposals are a return to Glass-Steagall in all but name."

If people continue to deleverage, it will reduce the potential for growth and commodity demand." SIMON MAUGHAN, ANALYST AT MF GLOBAL: "The biggest risk is that we're under a cloud of uncertainty all the way through to the U.S. mid-term elections, which is effectively for the whole year." COMMERZBANK ANALYSTS' NOTE: "We should really question why the plans have not put more pressure on the dollar - the reason is probably the uncertainty surrounding the actual implementation of such measures." GERHARD SCHWARZ, HEAD OF GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGY AT UNICREDIT IN MUNICH: "We have to digest that the reception in the last trading session in the U.S. to the Obama plan was very negative in the financial space and this has provoked some risk aversion across the board." BOFA MERRILL LYNCH ANALYSTS' NOTE: "Given the lack of clarity over whether those proposals will be implemented, and if so, in what form and over what timeframe, we see risks that uncertainty will hang over the market structure stocks," they say.

(Reuters) - Here is some reaction from around the world to President Barack Obama's proposals to limit financial risk taking.CHRIS TURNER, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY AT ING IN LONDON: "People were initially slightly shocked by the Obama plan and by the implications of what he was suggesting, but there is a question of how quickly it will be implemented." "It also shouldn't derail the Asian-led global recovery, which is good for commodity-linked currencies." PETER FERTIG, CONSULTANT WITH QUANTITATIVE COMMODITY RESEARCH: Said that while gold and other commodities had overreacted to the Obama news: "Uncertainty about U.S. financial system regulation is a factor which might be in the market for some time, until there are concrete details." SPANISH GOVERNMENT SOURCE: "I don't think such measures would have much application in Spain, given that proprietary trading is not a very generalized practice." "One thing is the measures as announced and another will be what goes ahead." "What would be logical would be for this kind of measure to be discussed via the G20 in a coordinated manner, and what I do think is positive is the philosophy of the reform, which makes the distinction between investment banking and retail banking." DUTCH FINANCE MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN: Said the ministry supported the "general aim" of Obama's "ambitious" proposals but cast doubt on whether they would be possible to implement.

The universal bank model is more prevalent in Europe and European markets have a greater need for the liquidity that flows from the universal bank model because our equity markets are less deep. In one sense it need not derail many of the things agreed at the G20 but it does alter the dynamic.

"It's a bank's holdings in hedge funds and PE funds which have provided much-needed stability when the value of other assets was swinging around like a flag in a gale. "Europe is already heading toward a separation of commercial and investment banking through the Basel/Capital Requirements Directive process. However the big question is whether we will get away with a separation within groups, that is we restructure European banks into a commercial subsidiary and an investment bank subsidiary, similar to the existing U.S. model, or whether it will be necessary to break bank groups up completely into deposit-taking commercial lenders and "merchant banks" - this is my "back to the future" argument.
