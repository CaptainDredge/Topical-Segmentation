Hasbro, known for its Nerf foam toys and Transformers action figures, posted lower sales in U.S. and Canada in sharp contrast to larger rival Mattel, which reported strong U.S. revenue on record sales of Barbie dolls. Retailers delayed some orders that were expected in September to the current quarter, boding well for the holiday season despite uncertainty in economic conditions playing on the minds of U.S. shoppers.

Wedbush Securities analyst Edward Woo said things were looking good for Hasbro in the fourth quarter and expects Hasbro to earn $3.02 a share on revenue of $4.4 billion for the year. Hasbro said it was seeing "good momentum" for its toys at retail and kept its outlook for "meaningful growth" in 2011 revenue and earnings.

"I think of our retail partners as planning for a fairly robust season," Chief Operating Officer David Hargreaves said on a conference call with analysts. "Certainly as we talk to them at the moment they all plan that their business with us will be up this year." Hasbro's shipments in North America were coming in ahead of last year's numbers so far in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Brian Goldner said on the call.

Sterne, Agee & Leach analyst Margaret Whitfield said Hasbro's outlook suggests its full-year earnings per share could top her expectations of $3 and the consensus estimate of $2.98. International revenue jumped 23 percent in the third quarter, somewhat offsetting the disappointing 7 percent drop in revenue from United States and Canada.
