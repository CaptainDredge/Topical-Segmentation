In the letter, Berlin said debt could still fall to the required 124 percent level by reducing the interest Greece pays on its rescue loans or via a new buyback for bondholders who refused to take part in a debt restructuring earlier this year. A study prepared for euro zone finance ministers in late November said such a buyback would cut Greece's debt by 0.5 percentage points of GDP in 2020 and 2022, assuming 1 billion euros was spent to buy back bonds at 50 percent of face value.

In a letter to lawmakers obtained by Reuters, Germany's finance ministry recommended paying out the next tranche of aid to Athens, saying the bond scheme had ensured Greek debt was sustainable. "Overall the buyback can be called a success," said the letter, adding that "the other conditions for the payment of further financial help for Greece have been met".

Earlier, IMF director Christine Lagarde said that she too was satisfied with the outcome. "I can only welcome the results that have been produced by the debt buyback," she said late on Tuesday after Greece confidentially revealed the results to lenders. The program accounts for about half of a broader debt relief package that lenders agreed for Athens last month, and its success had been seen as essential to keeping the IMF committed to a rescue plan mounted jointly with the EU.

The buyback has had to jump several hurdles before Greece's lenders could proclaim its viability. Athens had to extend the deadline to Tuesday after falling short of an initial 30 billion euro target for bonds offered, and then had to rely on its own cash-strapped banks to push it above that threshold.

"I consider it likely that we can reach an agreement on paying the next loan tranche in the meeting tomorrow," said Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen of Finland, one of the sharpest critics of Greek reform efforts. Analysts also felt euro zone finance ministers would be able to tie up the loose ends, removing the threat of a Greek bankruptcy and a euro zone exit that has hung over financial markets and the bloc for months.
