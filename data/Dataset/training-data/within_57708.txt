Sanofi dismissed the figure as "totally unrealistic" at the time, and company officials declined to comment on Genzyme's latest Campath market projections. Many of the claims for Campath superiority over other current MS treatments, including the potential to reverse disease disability, must be borne out by data from large late-stage studies expected to become available next year.

Few analysts believe that Campath, which is already sold as a leukemia treatment, will generate the kind of sales projected by Genzyme. Independent market research group BioMedTracker has forecast Campath sales of about $1.6 billion in 2019. Genzyme said that physicians consulted on Campath's prospects strongly associate the drug "with best-in-class efficacy" and believe it will be safer than Biogen Idec's ( BIIB.O ) Tysabri.

"A CVR at this point may be the best idea" to bring the two sides together, he said. A LITTLE EXTRA Investors and analysts had said a deal could be reached at $75 to $80 per share. But a deal involving CVR would be complex and shareholders may not accept it unless Sanofi also increased its $69 cash offer to the low $70-range, some say.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genzyme Corp GENZ.O held its second investor meeting in two months to argue that its most promising experimental drug will capture five times the sales that Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) has assumed in a hostile $18.5 billion takeover bid.Genzyme seeks a significantly higher price than the $69 per share that France's Sanofi has offered the U.S. biotech's shareholders.

"They have to sweeten the underlying price," said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. "If they sweeten the current price, a CVR could be a little extra to get a deal over the line." Termeer told reporters after the meeting that shareholders he has spoken to have been "very supportive" of the CVR idea.
