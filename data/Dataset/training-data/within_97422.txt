The trading debacle has picked up the same "London Whale" nickname that hedge funds gave to a JPMorgan trader for the outsized derivatives bets he placed for the company. The ISS recommendations on the re-election of directors shows the shareholder debate over governance of the company is broadening beyond Dimon. The three directors who ISS singled out for replacement were members of the board's risk policy committee in December 2010 when the committee was shown a presentation by management that highlighted large profits from trading strategies in the firm's Chief Investment Office, where the derivative losses later occurred.

A statement from JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau on Saturday said: "The company strongly endorses the re-election of its current directors and disagrees with ISS's position." ISS also renewed its recommendation from a year ago that CEO and Chairman of the Board Jamie Dimon give up one of those two titles. ISS said investigations of the derivatives loss, which surfaced right before last year's shareholder meeting, showed that JPMorgan executives need more independent oversight and that the company is too big and too complex for one person to be able to do both jobs.

The company statement added: "While the company has acknowledged a number of mistakes relating to its losses in CIO, an independent review committee of the board determined that those mistakes were not attributable to the risk committee." In its proxy statement for the coming meeting, the board said that the actions taken by the company after the "London Whale" debacle show it to be strong and independent.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) shareholders should vote against the re-election of three board members because they failed to properly oversee risk-taking that led to $6.2 billion of losses on the so-called "London Whale" trades, an influential proxy advisory firm said.ISS Proxy Advisory Services said in a report released late Friday that directors David Cote, James Crown and Ellen Flutter should not be re-elected at the company's annual meeting this month because of "material failures of stewardship and risk oversight." The report by ISS ratchets up pressure on directors to reduce Dimon's power at JPMorgan, the biggest bank based in the United States, as some stockholders push for more supervision of the outspoken executive.

After the loss, the board added a member to the risk policy committee - new director Timothy Flynn, a retired chairman of auditor KPMG International. ISS, which researches proxy issues and makes voting recommendations to institutional investors, praised the company for putting Flynn on the panel and recommended that shareholders re-elect him as well as seven other directors.
