So as we are losing Libyan production, we should offset it by increasing the quota of other members." WILL RILEY, CO-MANAGER, GUINNESS GLOBAL ENERGY FUND: "It's not a huge surprise because they do need to raise production. We do expect OPEC to increase production to compensate for the Libyan outage over the rest of this year.

They would have to sell below current market levels, so it will depend on whether they are willing to do that." LEO DROLLAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CENTRE FOR GLOBAL ENERGY STUDIES: "Targets are out of date and have no relevance, so if they have to change these, it's a huge exercise, especially given problems with Libya.

"An increase of 1.5 million bpd is unlikely. OPEC are sensibly trying to keep the oil price within a band of $75/80 to $125 per barrel. They recognize that anything at the upper end of that price range starts to have an effect on demand. They recognize that the world economy continues to be fragile and it's in no one's best interest including their own to scupper that recovery." "We believe that, over time, OPEC would be very happy to manage the oil price back down below $100 and that something between $80-$100, more likely toward the top end of that range in the shorter term, is what OPEC would be happy to see." MARK THOMAS, HEAD OF ENERGY EUROPE, MAREX FINANCIAL: "Increasing (the) official quota in reality changes nothing.

There's a mini cartel within the main one." OLIVIER JAKOB, CONSULTANT, PETROMATRIX, ZUG, SWITZERLAND: "We continue to believe that it will be difficult for OPEC to make any formal adjustments to the individual quotas given the legal implications of having Libya being part of any new agreement. Any additional supply will anyway mostly come out of Saudi Arabia, and what is relevant is not what OPEC does but what Saudi Arabia does." "A few OPEC watchers are indicating an increase of Saudi production/supplies in June, and if formally confirmed by Saudi Arabia, that should be enough to counter any negative sentiment coming out of a lack of decisive formal plan from OPEC." ROY JORDAN, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, FACTS GLOBAL ENERGY: "I believe that a higher ceiling would only be a gesture toward the call from politicians in major importing countries for more oil and would not have much impact on the level of crude prices nor on the economy.

If they want to make an impact on crude prices, they can always reduce their own official selling prices, just as consumer governments could reduce domestic prices by lowering tax levels." CHRISTOPHE BARRET, GLOBAL OIL ANALYST, CREDIT AGRICOLE: "Current OPEC production ... is close to 1.2-1.5 million above quota. An increase of around 1-1.5 million would just put the quota in line with actual production." "In terms of physical supply, it will have little impact as they already produce much more than quota.
