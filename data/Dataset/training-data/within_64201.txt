"This would give Greece the necessary time to carry out reforms and win back confidence," he said. "It would limit the risks of a negative market reaction, establish fair burden-sharing between taxpayers and the private sector and send a clear signal to all that losses cannot be pushed on to taxpayers alone." ECB OPPOSED ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet made clear on Thursday the central bank opposed any scheme for private sector involvement that would cause a "credit event" or be considered by credit ratings agencies as a "selective default." Reflecting the sensitive nature of the debate within the ECB, Trichet's deputy Vitor Constancio was forced on Friday to retract comments made earlier in the day in which he said his boss was not ruling out an extension of Greek maturities.

In a clarification statement issued by the ECB, Constancio parroted the stance Trichet laid out at his Thursday news conference, saying that he excluded all concepts that were not purely voluntary. The ECB is concerned that tinkering with Greek debt may set off a chain reaction in financial markets that would stretch far beyond Greece and undermine the creditworthiness of other stressed euro zone sovereigns.

"I think in the end the ECB will be ready to compromise." France favors a less sweeping form of private sector involvement in which bondholders are asked to commit voluntarily to roll over their Greek bonds when they mature, sources familiar with government thinking say. French President Nicolas Sarkozy will hold talks with Merkel on the euro zone crisis next Friday in Berlin in what could be a decisive meeting between Europe's central powers a week before the EU summit.

The risk premiums on peripheral euro zone sovereign bonds rose on Friday as investors fretted over the lack of consensus just two weeks before the summit. But European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who will chair the EU summit, said he was confident there would be an agreement on a new package for Greece by the end of the month, "creating no default or credit event." Schaeuble dismissed criticism of his bond swap plan, telling lawmakers it was a fair solution that would protect taxpayers.

At a Brussels summit on June 23-24, European Union leaders are due to finalize a new rescue package for Greece that officials say will total 120 billion euros and ensure the country is funded through 2014. Half of that sum would come from the EU and IMF, with the remainder equally divided between privatization receipts and a contribution from the private sector, but deep divisions remain about how to get the banks that hold Greek debt on board.
