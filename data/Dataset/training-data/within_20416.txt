The market downturn has also sparked losses on its stock holdings. January-March group net profit was 142.05 billion yen, according to Reuters calculations, versus 45.3 billion yen a year earlier. Rather than strong growth, the results represent a rebound from the previous year, when earnings were sliced by massive losses at money lending affiliate Promise Co 8574.T. Reuters calculated the quarterly figures from SMFG's full-year and nine-month earnings statements filed with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

That's only a sliver of the 645 billion yen that rival Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ) lost on subprime-related investments. But while SMFG has little subprime exposure, it has taken greater hits from its ties to the consumer finance industry, where stricter regulations have dented profits. Faced with a weak domestic economy, it has seen sluggish lending growth and been forced to raise provisions against bad loans.

For the year to March 2009, SMFG forecast a profit of 480 billion yen, well below the market consensus of 547.8 billion yen. Tokyo banks have also been hurt by slow lending in the world's second-largest economy. Many Japanese corporates now shun loans after recovering from a 1990s asset bubble and cleaning up their balance sheets.
