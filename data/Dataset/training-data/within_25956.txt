"If they take a big position in Goldman, you can definitely say it would be a positive over the medium- to long-term," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. "If they take a big enough position so that they can benefit from Goldman's know-how and human resources, it will be positive." Once considered too naive and cautious for the high-risk, high-return world of investment banking, cash-rich Japanese firms have largely avoided the huge credit losses of the subprime mortgage crisis, leaving them well-placed to pick up the best assets from the carnage on Wall Street.

Tokyo's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T rose 1.1 percent. "Nomura was able to buy Lehman after it filed for bankruptcy so I think investors think that Nomura got Lehman on the cheap," said Nana Otsuki, banking analyst at UBS in Tokyo. "It kind of seems that MUFG might have been able to get Morgan Stanley cheaper if they had waited a little," she added.

Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley secured approval from the Federal Reserve to become commercial, deposit-taking banks this week, signaling the end of an era for Wall Street's free-wheeling, investment banking model. Some analysts had previously speculated that Goldman could turn to SMFG for funding, because the two companies have a history of investing in each other.

In 2003, Goldman bought 150 billion yen in convertible preferred shares of SMFG, giving it a much-needed capital injection while in the 1980s, SMFG's predecessor bank helped bail out Goldman. Sumitomo Mitsui said in June it would pay 500 million pounds ($927 million) to take a 2 percent stake in British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ).
