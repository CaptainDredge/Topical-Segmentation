But Strattera, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fell 7 percent to $156 million, as concerns about safety of the class of medicines continues to hurt U.S. sales. Diabetes drug Actos had sales of $90 million, a 42 percent decline, due to Lilly' loss in September of U.S. marketing rights to the drug.

Lilly denied Zyprexa is more likely to cause diabetes than rival drugs and said the Times had improperly obtained its internal documents and taken them out of context. Cymbalta sales leaped 85 percent to $424 million, amid soaring demand in the United States and introductions of the drug in more overseas markets.

The Reuters Estimates forecast is $3.34 per share. Lilly said its forecast would have been about 10 cents per share -- or 3 percentage points -- higher if not for the dilutive impact of its recent purchase of biotechnology company Icos Corp. Profit growth will also be crimped by heavy spending on research, including late-stage trials of an experimental blood clot drug called prasugrel that Lilly deems potentially superior to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s ( BMY.N ) blockbuster Plavix.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co. ( LLY.N ) said on Wednesday fourth-quarter earnings fell, hurt by a charge for a settlement with users of its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug, and the company forecast 2007 earnings at the low end of Wall Street estimates.But shares of Lilly, whose profit beat forecasts on lower taxes and price hikes for its medicines that drove revenue growth, were up 1.5 percent in morning trading.

Sales should grow this year in the high single or low double-digit percentage range, Lilly said. Global Zyprexa revenue rose 12 percent to $1.16 billion, largely due to price increases. The company said U.S. demand for the pill remained flat. The drug's use has been crimped by concerns over weight gains that can increase risk of diabetes.
