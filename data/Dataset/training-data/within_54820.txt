WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday on financial reform. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, SEC Chairman Mary Shapiro, Treasury Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and acting Comptroller of the Currency John Walsh testify.SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CHRISTOPHER DODD ON TURF FIGHTING "We certainly expect the members of the oversight council to share information and to cooperate and to create an atmosphere where any agency is free to contribute in all of this.

GENSLER ON MAY 6 SUPPLEMENT REPORT: "Within the next couple of days, I think we'll put out this May 6 supplemental report.
