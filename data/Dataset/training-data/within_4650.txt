He said on Tuesday the acquisition strategy was paying off. "We think we have a good chance to catch and pass SAP in the overall applications business," Ellison told an investor conference call. "We closed the gap and gained applications market share again this quarter." New license revenue rose to $1.39 billion in the quarter to February 28, from $1.1 billion.

"Their share of the enterprise application market is growing faster than SAP's," said Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities. "That is all there is to it." Oracle Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz cited a strong global performance across all product lines and said the world's biggest database software maker turned in its fastest third-quarter growth in more than five years.

"These guys are on the first line of companies determining whether to spend more on infrastructure." "It is good to see that they are, at least in this quarter." Oracle has spent more than $20 billion buying rivals such as Siebel Systems and PeopleSoft over the past three years to challenge SAP, which leads the market in applications that help companies automate everything from accounting to human resources to inventory management.
