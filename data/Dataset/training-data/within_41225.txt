In March, when the S&P 500 hit an intraday low below 700, investors were pricing in a doomsday scenario in the economy and financial markets. That nightmare outcome is now off the table as signs of recovery continue to sprout. "A lot of people are coming to the realization that total meltdown is off the table," said Robert Auer, a fund manager at SB Auer Funds in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Seven years later the S&P 500  .SPX  had more than tripled in value without ever pulling back by 10 percent. This was not the only time markets have run ahead without a significant correction. Coming out of a bear market after the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 surged 95 percent from 2003 to 2007, again, without a 10 percent correction.

"You might not get that decline if that's what you're waiting for," said Cleveland Rueckert, market strategist at Birinyi Associates in Stamford, Connecticut. "A lot of people have been and probably will be surprised how far the market can go." Six months before the United States pulled out of recession in March 1991 the stock market began to rally.

He is watching a target of 1100 to 1150 on the S&P 500 as a sell sign and believes the bottom of the range could be as low as 750, representing a fall of up to 27 percent. In late Tuesday trade, the S&P was at 1030.4. "We think the rally has more to go but it's probably in its late innings right now and we'll play it for that," he said.

But economic improvement and stock-market gains are not one and the same. "You do yourself a disservice if you're equating the March rally one-to-one with an economic turnaround," said Bill Strazullo, partner and chief investment strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston. "That's certainly part of it, but it's not the whole story." Strazullo is one of those who believes a pullback could be around the corner.
