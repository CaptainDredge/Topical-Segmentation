"If Huijin fully participates in the share placement, the amount that goes to the market will actually be much smaller than the targeted 60 billion yuan," said Everbright's Feng. In its Friday announcement, Bank of China did not specify prices for the rights offering. Analysts said that based on past experience with other Chinese banks, the rights should be priced at a discount of 30-40 percent to the bank's current share price.

HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Bank of China ( 3988.HK ) ( 601988.SS ) said its bid to raise up to $8.9 billion should give it enough capital for the next three years, seeking to assure markets its second major fund-raising this year will mend its stretched balance sheet for the foreseeable future.Bank of China's move caught many off guard in part because it comes just as Agricultural Bank of China ABC.UL, the nation's No.3 lender, is preparing to launch an IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong, expected to raise $20 billion or more later this week.

"The total amount of the fund-raising is within our expectations, the surprise is mainly on the timing and the amount targeted for the A-share market," said Victor Feng, an analyst with Everbright Securities. "Assuming the placement was fully implemented, the bank's ... capital adequacy ratio will be raised by 1 percentage point, which is enough to sustain the bank's operations for the next three years," he said, adding CAR now stands at 11.09 percent versus a government-mandated minimum of 11.5 percent." Despite its large size, the fundraising should also have less market impact than its large numbers imply because many of the new shares would presumably be purchased by the bank's largest shareholder, Central Huijin Investment Co, a government entity that holds about 68 percent of the bank.

One such step, which China has resorted to several times in the past, could be a freeze on new fundraising in Shanghai by locally listed companies. In an investor call on Monday, the bank said it aimed to complete the rights offer by year end, and that it expected no further need for additional fundraising in the next three years, according to several analysts on the call.

"It's a good timing to invest in Bank of China and other Chinese banking shares, because valuation-wise, they are very attractive," he said of China banks, whose shares have dropped sharply this year on fund-raising concerns. TIME GAP Despite the close timing, analysts said the two fundraising plans were not likely to fall too close together, as Bank of China's plan still required shareholder approval and was likely to be at least a month before it could proceed.
