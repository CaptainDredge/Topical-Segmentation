"For whoever comes in, the challenge of Minas Rio and the challenge of restructuring the platinum industry in South Africa doesn't go away," said analyst Des Kilalea at RBC in London. "To some extent, it's probably the most difficult mining company to manage at the moment." Industry analysts, industry sources and investors point to at least two likely successors for Carroll - Brazilian Alex Vanselow, the former chief financial officer of BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) and South African-born Mick Davis, the outgoing chief executive of Xstrata XTA.L. Parker - in a reference to a storm over Davis' pay, one of the highest on Britain's FTSE - said Anglo could not afford him.

Internally, analysts point to Chris Griffith, a well-regarded platinum veteran who was plucked from his job at the helm of Kumba in July to run Anglo American Platinum ( AMSJ.J ). His recent arrival, however, may remove him from consideration. A new name may not prove an immediate solution for Anglo's troubles, from cost pressures to Brazilian delays, even if analysts said the company could use the opportunity to review its involvement in South Africa as well as platinum and sell a stake in the costly Minas Rio project or write down its value.

Brushing aside suggestions she was pushed to leave, Carroll and Chairman John Parker, her long-standing supporter, said on Friday there had been "differences of opinion" with shareholders but the decision to step down was her own, as she approached a seventh year in a "very grueling and demanding role". Carroll's efforts to streamline a miner with colonial roots that became a sprawling conglomerate, her campaign to cut billions in costs and efforts to shift Anglo's centre of gravity away from South Africa have won her support among investors.

A campaign to improve ties with South Africa's government has also garnered plaudits. But her relationship with investors became more troubled after big-ticket acquisitions like the Minas Rio iron ore project in Brazil - an early bid to diversify Anglo's portfolio - which became mired in cost overruns and delays. Anglo has yet to give a final cost for the project it bought in a $5.5 billion deal at the top of the commodities cycle, but analysts say spending could rise to $8 billion from current forecasts of $5.8 billion, already twice original estimates.

LONDON  (Reuters) - Anglo American's ( AAL.L ) Chief Executive Cynthia Carroll has quit after more than five years in the job, under pressure from investors over the miner's lagging share price and continued dependence on troubled South Africa.A geologist by training, New Jersey-born Carroll ruffled feathers when, fresh from the aluminum industry, she became the first non-South African, the first woman and the first outsider to take the top job at Anglo in 2007.
