"No one familiar with the history of this country can deny that congressional committees are useful," said the Murrow quote reproduced in the paper. "It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one." A White House spokeswoman said President Barack Obama's administration was looking broadly at the opportunities, risks and implications of reliance on global, commercial markets, not aiming at "any particular company." "We understand the potential for risks to our country introduced via the supply chain for telecommunications equipment and services," said spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.

Huawei, second only in telecom gear sales worldwide to Sweden's Ericsson, pushed back with an 81-page paper titled "The Case for Huawei in America," published on the web site of its U.S. subsidiary Wednesday night. "Much of the evidence fueling lawmakers' concerns remains classified," said the heavily footnoted paper by Dan Steinbock, described as an authority on trade and investment and U.S.-Chinese relations.

Huawei and Bain Capital Partners were forced to give up their bid in 2008 for computer-equipment maker 3Com Corp after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States - an interagency group led by the Treasury Department - raised objections. Last year, Huawei dropped plans to buy certain assets from 3Leaf Systems, a computer services company, after more problems with the foreign investment panel.

The committee is completing a nearly year-long investigation of security threats allegedly posed by equipment sold by Shenzhen, China-based Huawei, as well as ZTE Corp, a smaller cross-town rival also frustrated by challenges entering the U.S. market. The concern is that their products may be booby-trapped and provide the Chinese "an opportunity for greater foreign espionage, threaten our critical infrastructure, or increase the opportunities for Chinese economic espionage," the Republican-led House Intelligence panel said in a notice about the hearing.

"However, when one set of allegations are substantiated with another set of allegations, the line between investigation and maltreatment grows thin," the Huawei-commissioned paper said, decrying "allegations based on allegations." Continued rebuffs of Huawei in the United States, the document added, "is giving rise to a de facto blueprint for mirror-like Chinese measures to protect perceived strategic industries in the mainland." William Plummer, a spokesman in the United States for Huawei, said the words in the paper belonged to Steinbock, not the company.
