NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday a sharp slide in stock markets on Tuesday has not changed the Fed's outlook for moderate U.S. growth."My view is that taking all the new data into account, that there is really no material change in our expectations for the U.S. economy since I last reported to Congress a couple weeks ago," Bernanke said in response to questions from the House Budget Committee.

COMMENTARY: STEVE GALLAGHER, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SOCIETE-GENERALE,  NEW YORK: "Bernanke has done the right job. He is holding to his earlier testimony -- more specific on the short-term scenario -- which is looking for a more moderate growth going forward. "He is also looking for some pick-up in the economy as the U.S. housing slowdown winds down.
