This is back to the 1970s. Life in Brown's Britainis like an episode of Life on Mars."

"If it does not prove possible to secure a proposal thatmeets our stated objectives and conditions, it would benecessary to take Northern Rock into temporary public ownership.For that reason it would be irresponsible to rule it out."DARLING ON NEED FOR PUBLIC FUNDS  "Whilst conditions are better now than they were beforeChristmas they remain difficult and the Government's financialadvisers believe that there is no chance of achieving a privatesector deal backed entirely with private finance in the nearfuture."DARLING ON ADMINISTRATION  "Administration would mean that control would immediatelypass to an administrator who would look to realise the value ofthe company's assets which, under current market conditions,would amount to a fire sale.

It could also exacerbate currentmarket turbulence. And costs would be significant. I havetherefore rejected such a proposal."DARLING ON GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE  "My proposal today is one in which Northern Rock is ownedand run in the private sector as a commercial bank - and wherethe Government provides a backstop guarantee to make privatefinancing possible in the current market conditions.
