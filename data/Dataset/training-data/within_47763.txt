NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve Bank's president would become a political appointee and bank chiefs like JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon could no longer sit on the board of their regulator under a proposal unveiled by the head of the Senate Banking Committee on Monday.As part of a new bill aimed at revamping financial regulation after the worst banking crisis since the 1930s, Senator Christopher Dodd's plan gives the president the power to name the head of the most important regional Fed bank.

The prospects for Dodd's bill are uncertain. Any legislation that emerges from his committee would need 60 votes in the Senate to overcome procedural roadblocks that are sure to be thrown up by Republicans; the Democrats control only 59 seats. The bill also proposes creating a second vice chairman of the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors, who would be in charge of supervision and testify to Congress twice a year -- a move meant to sharpen the central bank's focus on regulation.

Dodd's proposal would ban any past or current officer, director or employee of a firm supervised by the Fed from sitting on any of the regional Fed bank boards. That would, for one, affect JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) chief executive Jamie Dimon, who was recently reelected to a three-year term on the New York Fed's board that expires in 2012.

"The bill clamps down on conflicts of interest at the Federal Reserve, making the head of the New York Fed, for example, a position appointed by the president of the United States and not hand-picked by the very bankers the New York Fed is responsible for regulating," the Connecticut Democrat told reporters as he unveiled his bill.

-----

Regional Fed boards offer anecdotal information to policymakers and make recommendations on monetary policy, but they have no policy-making powers. Dodd's proposal would also eliminate the role banks now play in naming two-thirds of regional Fed bank directors. No company that is supervised by the Fed could vote for directors of a Fed bank under Dodd's plan.
