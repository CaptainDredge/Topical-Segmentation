He said he would redouble efforts to raise 1.7 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in privatizations by September, as agreed with the EU and the IMF who pulled Greece back from the brink of bankruptcy with a 110 billion-euro bailout a year ago. Greece must deliver 50 billion euros in proceeds from a massive and complicated state selloff by 2015, including 5 billion this year.

So far, in 18 months in office, the socialists have yet to launch any privatizations. Amid the worst recession in nearly 40 years, good news for the economy comes from the tourism sector, which makes up about 15 percent of GDP. Revenues are seen rising by about 10 percent this year after a 25 percent slump in 2009-2010, Venizelos said.

Asked about a warning by the S&P rating agency that banks' plans to roll over Greek debt could be seen as default, which drove down the euro on Monday, Venizelos said it was crucial that any model included the strictly voluntary participation of private lenders. "As markets are strict and merciless, we want the format that results from the next program to have a shape that is accepted by markets and they react positively," he said.

"We will make it, because this is vital not only for Greece but for the stability of the whole euro zone and the global economy, because in Greece the stamina of the financial system is being tested," he told Reuters in the second part of an interview. Appointed in a June 17 reshuffle and speaking after euro zone finance ministers approved on Saturday a critical, fifth tranche of a bailout loan to avert default, Venizelos said he was grateful to EU partners and vowed to fulfill his obligations.

Greece has 20 days from Saturday to set up a privatization body and Venizelos said he would unveil its board to fellow Eurogroup ministers on July 11. "I will announce this after I complete discussions with the opposition on the 2-3 key people, because we need the widest possible consensus," he said.
