Wall Street on average was looking for first quarter revenue growth of 8.8 percent and second quarter of 9.5 percent. "It might have been worse than that," said Jefferies analyst Bill Choi. "If anything, it gives people confidence that off this low Q1 number they are anticipating a sequential rise." Chambers also said he saw mixed signals in the economy, stock market and energy costs, but that the challenges would be relatively short term.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc posted stronger-than-expected quarterly results and said it expected the weak economic environment to be relatively short term, sending its shares up 7 percent after the market closed on Tuesday.Investors took heart from Chief Executive John Chambers' comment that he had "very strong" confidence in Cisco's long- term revenue growth target of 12 percent to 17 percent, even though the company's quarterly forecasts were a little light compared with average analyst estimates.

"During each economic slowdown, Cisco has always navigated through them very effectively gained wallet share and in my opinion market share," he said. Analysts have also said Cisco was relatively resistant to economic downturns because it has broadened its customer base, as well as its product line and geographic reach. While it is best known for selling routers and switches, it has expanded into software and new technologies such as video conferencing.

Its profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ended July 26 rose to $2.0 billion, or 33 cents a share, from $1.9 billion, or 31 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Earnings excluding items was 40 cents per share, exceeding the average analyst forecast by a penny, according to Reuters Estimates.

Quarterly revenue rose 9.9 percent to $10.4 billion, surpassing $10 billion for the first time. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.3 billion. Analysts said they were particularly happy with Cisco's announcement that its book to bill ratio was "comfortably over" 1, indicating a healthy balance of demand to supply.
