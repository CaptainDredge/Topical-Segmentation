Under Wolff, designers are crafting a new look aimed at younger consumers "who enjoy fine things, but are not overt 'badge-wearers,'" said a Ford executive familiar with Lincoln's evolving game plan. Wolff is also overseeing the styling of two other Lincolns - the redesigned 2015 MKX midsize crossover, due in the autumn of 2014, and the redesigned 2016 MKS full size sedan, expected in the spring of 2015, according to two industry analysts familiar with the plans.

For 2016, a luxury rear-wheel-drive coupe could share its underpinnings with the Ford Mustang and could be assembled at Ford's Flat Rock plant in Michigan. Ford says its new Lincoln lineup could draw about a quarter of the U.S. premium car market now up for grabs as the economy recovers. "They are looking for something new," said Jim Farley, head of global marketing and the Lincoln brand, in an interview with Reuters Television on Monday.

Daimler AG's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes-Benz, the top-selling luxury brand, has sold about three times more vehicles than Lincoln this year. The average Lincoln buyer is 65 years old. Ford wants to lower that to 57 and raise the target average income by more than 50 percent to nearly $160,000 a year.

"What's good is Lincoln's push to differentiate itself from Ford," said Sam Stevens, a dealer for Stevens Auto Group in Milford, Connecticut. "Why would you buy (Lincoln) if you can buy the same thing on the floor for less?" Ford declined to confirm its $1 billion investment in the Lincoln brand or its planned compact crossover.

"They really don't have a brand out there that really talks to them individually." But Wolkonowicz and other experts said the Lincoln lineup still does not have a "design signature" such as the sharp, more aggressive look Wolff helped refine at Cadillac. "Lincoln's image is lagging behind, compared to its actual product line," said TrueCar.com analyst Jesse Toprak.
