In January, the two had each been sentenced to six monthsin prison and fined $250,000 after being found guilty of onecount of securities fraud at trial. In a written order, a panel of three judges on the appealscourt said the evidence against the men "was insufficient toprove 'deception."'  Hayward and Stern had been specialists on the NYSE tradingfloor, responsible for executing trades for NYSE customers aswell as trading their firm's own accounts.

Last year, a Manhattan federal court judge tossed out theverdict against former specialist David Finnerty, who was foundguilty of fraud in October 2006 for allegedly making illegaltrades that cheated the exchange's customers out of $4.5million.
