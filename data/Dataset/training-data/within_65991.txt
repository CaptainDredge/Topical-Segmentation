The comments were the most forthcoming Goldman has used to describe the J. Aron commodities trading division in at least a decade, according to a review of its earning statements, suggesting it may have fared even worse than in the market collapse of 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Tuesday blamed its commodities trading desk for much of the massive drop in trading profits in the second quarter, even after its own analysts correctly called for a pull-back in prices.In a sign of how an abrupt slump in commodities and energy prices caught out many big players, Goldman said it had "significantly lower results" in its commodities and mortgage businesses.

There was no explanation of how and why it took more risks in commodities trading. ANALYSTS CALLED IT The slide in most commodities and energy prices occurred after Goldman Sachs' commodities research team -- famed for making bullish calls -- surprised markets in mid-April by suggesting clients lock-in trading profits, a recommendation it reinforced several times in the following weeks.

The firm closely guards any information about its trading profits. In a statement, Goldman said its fixed income, currency and commodities client-execution businesses generated net revenue of $1.6 billion, down $1.8 billion from the second quarter of 2010, resulting in the significant drop in results. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told a conference call the commodities business, in particular, was "negatively impacted by asset price fluctuations".

It also recommended they underweight commodities over a three- to six-month period, but maintained a longer-term bullish outlook. The rebound arrived slightly earlier than expected, with crude oil prices having risen some $15 a barrel from their June low. What Goldman may have not foreseen was another tumble in prices in the third week of June, around the time the United States and other major Western consuming nations announced they were releasing emergency crude stockpiles.
