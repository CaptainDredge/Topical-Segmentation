WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Almost a third of Americans plan to spend less on the holidays this year, mainly because they need to use their money for daily expenses, according to a survey released on Tuesday.The Consumer Federation of America and the Credit Union National Association found 32 percent of shoppers want to spend less than they did during the 2005 holidays.

About half of the survey's roughly 1,000 respondents said they would like to spend about the same. Only 15 percent intended to spend more. Rising energy costs are forcing many to deck the halls more sparsely this year, the report found, but general household expenses and tight family finances are also dragging down holiday budgets.
