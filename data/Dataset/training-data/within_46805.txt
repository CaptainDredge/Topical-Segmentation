NEW DELHI/LONDON  (Reuters) - Bharti Airtel ( BRTI.BO ) is in exclusive talks to buy most of Kuwaiti telecom group Zain's ( ZAIN.KW ) African business, the Indian firm's third attempt at gaining a foothold in a continent that offers a last opportunity for major subscriber growth.Under the exclusivity period the companies have until March 25 to seal the $10.7 billion deal -- the second largest in the industry this year after Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim's move to consolidate his telecoms empire.

"Chances of a deal happening this time are very high unless some regulatory issues come up." However, Bharti's share price slumped more than 9 percent at the close of the Mumbai market, wiping around $2.4 billion off the firm's market value and marking their biggest daily fall since October 6, amid fears that the Zain deal may prove expensive.

Bharti, controlled by billionaire Chairman Sunil Mittal and Zain said the deal was still subject to due diligence and regulatory approvals. But Mohamed Al Kharafi, chairman of Kuwait's Kharafi group, which owns 11.47 percent of Zain through one of its units, told Indian television he was confident a deal would go through and that an all-cash transaction was planned.

EMERGING POWERHOUSE Zain, with its African and Middle East businesses, had been considered a natural target for Bharti, which has thrived in an Indian market with low incomes and tariffs and a heavily rural population -- characteristics shared by African nations. Mobile phone penetration in half of Africa's countries was below 40 percent as of August and a dozen countries had penetration below 30 percent, according to a research report.

Zain pulled back from an expansion spree last year, rejecting an offer from France's Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) for its African assets. Indian brokerage Batlivala & Karani Securities said Bharti's move was "directionally positive" due to challenging conditions at home, but the deal's valuation looked expensive. It said Bharti was valuing the Zain assets at an enterprise value of nine times EBITDA earnings and 13,000 rupees ($280) per subscriber.
