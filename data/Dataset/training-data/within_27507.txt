Upon completion of the Delta/Northwest merger, Steenland will conclude a dramatic four-year tenure as CEO of the fifth largest U.S. airline by revenue. During that time, he presided over a 20-month bankruptcy that cut $2.4 billion from the company's annual costs and made him the target of rage by employees who sacrificed to keep the airline in business.

The airlines said their merger would create a company better positioned to survive in a high-cost environment.
