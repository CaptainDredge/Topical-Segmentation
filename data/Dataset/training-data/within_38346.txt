COMMENTS JERRY REISMAN, PARTNER, REISMAN, PEIREZ AND REISMAN, NEW YORK "Unless Chrysler is allowed to reorganize and sell its assets to Fiat, GM will certainly face the same type of opposition from objecting creditors which will doom GM's reorganization."

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. Supreme Court justice on Monday granted a request to put on hold the sale of bankrupt automaker Chrysler LLC to a group led by Italian carmaker Fiat SpA.U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a one-sentence order, said the orders of the bankruptcy judge allowing the sale "are stayed pending further order of the undersigned or of the court."

SHERYL TOBY, ATTORNEY, CO-LEADER OF BANKRUPTCY PRACTICE GROUP, DYKEMA, BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MICHIGAN "The real issue is that when you do a sale through section 363 of the bankruptcy code, there are provisions that basically make that irreversible from a practical sense because it can become final immediately.

Indiana pension funds and consumer groups had asked the Supreme Court on Sunday to stop the sale of Chrysler to Fiat while they challenge the deal. The funds argued that the sale of Chrysler unlawfully rewards unsecured creditors ahead of secured lenders and amounts to an illegal reorganization plan, and that the U.S. Treasury Department overstepped its legal authority by using bailout funds for Chrysler when Congress intended the money for banks.

We have no transparency on any of it. "I haven't really seen much like this before. This whole thing is pretty unusual." CONGRESSMAN GARY PETERS, WHOSE DISTRICT IS HOME TO CHRYSLER WORLD HEADQUARTERS "It is quite clear that Indiana's case is not in the best interest of the people of Indiana.
