Oil prices fell on Friday, helping to cushion the market's decline. High fuel costs have been adding to concerns about consumer spending and corporate profits. U.S. crude for August delivery settled at $128.88 a barrel, down 41 cents. Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.71 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.28 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.17 billion.

IBM's shares rose 2.7 percent to $129.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. With earnings season now in full flow, analysts expect second-quarter S&P 500 earnings to drop 17.1 percent. If second-quarter earnings end up being lower, it will be the fourth consecutive quarter of negative growth for the S&P 500, the longest losing streak in six years, according to Thomson Reuters proprietary research.

On top of that, the biggest weekly drop ever in oil prices also gave investors a renewed appetite for equities. Despite their weekly gain, tech stocks ended the week with a thud. Google's stock fell almost 10 percent, its biggest one-day percentage drop since it went public in 2004, and Microsoft shares slid 6 percent, a day after the tech bellwethers' quarterly results fell short of expectations.

"The government's plan to provide funding for Fannie and Freddie and the SEC's short-selling rule put a floor, for now, under financials. But you'll start to see investors increasingly differentiate between 'the haves and have nots' in financials," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial, in Westport, Connecticut. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 49.91 points, or 0.44 percent, to 11,496.57.
