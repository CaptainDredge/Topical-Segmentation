"After three days of moving to the upside, the market was prone to profit-taking and then we heard the rumor that Gaddafi was dead," said Peter Beutel, president of Cameron Hanover in New Canaan, Connecticut. "It was almost like the fever was breaking anyway, and this was the bucket of water that brought the temperature down quickly." Traders said an increase in margin requirements for U.S. crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange in London also added pressure to prices late in the day.

Prices surged in early activity on news the Libyan revolt had caused large disruptions in the OPEC nation's oil supplies -- potentially up to three-quarters of output -- though the scale of the loss could not be confirmed.
