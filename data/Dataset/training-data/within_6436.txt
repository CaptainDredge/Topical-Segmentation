Revenues for Media, the largest contributor to Disney operating income, were flat in the quarter from last year's second quarter, when the ABC network benefited from advertising revenue from the Super Bowl and some college football games. Yet with costs also down due to the absence of all the football, and growth at sports network ESPN and international Disney Channels, segment operating income grew 21 percent.

ABC benefited from higher prices for spot advertising, which helped overcome the effect of lower ratings. Prices for spot ad sales are running double-digit percentages ahead of last year's third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts the current television advertising market looks strong, which should contribute to successful upfront sales later this month.

Prudential Equity Group analyst Katherine Styponias said in a note she expects Disney profit growth to continue due to its summer movie slate, strength at ESPN and ABC, and lower costs at its studio division. Disney shares slipped $35.82 in after-hours trade after closing on Tuesday at $36.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.

"CARS" MERCHANDISE The consumer products division posted 14 percent revenue growth for the quarter and a 20 percent rise in operating income due to growth in royalties from "Cars" merchandise and other products. Disney's video game studio also contributed more revenue thanks to publishing more company-owned titles. The parks and resorts division saw revenue grow 9 percent while operating income grew 19 percent due to higher ticket prices and average room rates as well as higher guest spending.

"For the media networks, the operating income was outstanding." Swing factors for the studio this quarter include the box office performances of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" and "Ratatouille." Profit rose in all four Disney divisions last quarter. Studio revenue was down 13 percent from last year, when the company had more theatrical releases and benefited from the international theatrical releases of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "Chicken Little." But operating profit at the division improved by 60 percent as moderately budgeted films like middle-aged motorbike comedy "Wild Hogs" and fantasy adventure "Bridge to Terabithia" did well at worldwide box offices.
