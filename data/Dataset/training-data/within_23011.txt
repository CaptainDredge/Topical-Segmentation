Excluding restructuring charges, Merrill lost $4.42 per share, far more than the $1.94 per share loss that analysts on average expected, according to Reuters Estimates. Merrill recorded $9.4 billion of write-downs from exposure to CDOs, residential mortgages, bond insurers and other investments. It has written down about $40 billion since the credit crisis began a year ago, leading to net losses exceeding $19.2 billion.

"They're moving in the right direction but Merrill still has significant challenges, including material exposure to collateralized debt obligations," said Chris Armbruster, an analyst at Al Frank Asset Management, which holds 24,000 Merrill shares. "We like the company, but it's going to be a tough go." Merrill's shares fell $1.83, or 6 percent, to $28.90 in after-hours trading.

Merrill's shares had risen $2.73, or 9.8 percent, during the day after JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and triggered a broader financial rally. But Merrill's losses may dampen optimism in the financial sector, a day before Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) posts results. Merrill said it is in discussions to sell a controlling stake in its Financial Data Services Inc unit, which provides mutual fund administrative services and retail banking products, to an undisclosed party in a transaction valuing the unit at more than $3.5 billion.

The unit is part of Merrill's brokerage business. It also said it has completed and is helping finance the long-expected sale of its 20 percent stake in Bloomberg LP, the news and financial data company, to Bloomberg Inc for $4.43 billion. The quarterly loss applicable to common stockholders was $4.89 billion, or $4.97 per share, after a profit of $2.07 billion, or $2.24 per share, a year earlier.

Results included losses of $3.5 billion from exposure to CDOs, $2.9 billion related to hedges, $1.7 billion from an investment portfolio of the company's U.S. banks, and $1.3 billion from residential mortgages. Merrill said it has reduced staffing by about 4,200 this year, leaving it with about 60,000 full-time employees at the end of June.
