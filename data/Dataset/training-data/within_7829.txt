Chrysler spent $1.6 billion. By contrast, on a combined basis, foreign automakers with U.S. plants, including Japan's own Big Three -- Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) and Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ), paid just $23 million for retiree health care in the United States.

He also said the union would "not negotiate in the press" as it heads into contract negotiations beginning July.
