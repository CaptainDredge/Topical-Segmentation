Kraft shares have moved lower since the deal was announced, and based on a Kraft price of $27.96 on Friday morning, the deal was worth about 826.6 pence. But that decline was not expected to prevent Kraft from obtaining the majority of Cadbury shares it needs for the deal go through, investors and analysts said.

As late as five days before accepting Kraft's offer, Swanson noted, Cadbury Chairman Roger Carr was still "talking about how Kraft hadn't been good at integrating deals, hadn't been good at improving their own results over a several year history -- and now they are part of that business model." Even after the deal was announced, influential investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) is Kraft's largest shareholder, called the move a "bad deal," putting more pressure on Kraft Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld to deliver the cost-saving and revenue growth she has promised.

All large takeovers have risks when it comes to integrating the two companies, analysts said. But before Cadbury's board accepted a sweetened offer from Kraft on January 19, Cadbury's management, unions and even one of the members of Cadbury's founding families fiercely battled against Kraft's bid. "Beyond melding disparate corporate cultures, Cadbury's public dismissal of Kraft's business model and management decisions in recent months increases the challenges of this integration," Morningstar analyst Erin Swanson said.

A key for Kraft will be to really listen to Cadbury employees ideas when it comes to integrating the companies, Swanson said. "They need to go in with an open mind of how to best integrate that business into your operations, rather than going in with a set plan," she said.

A Kraft spokesman would not say what part of those cost savings would come from job cuts, though analysts expect some jobs to be lost when Kraft's 97,000 employees are combined with Cadbury's 45,000. PAST DEALS Kraft could take a page from the merger history books about missteps in hostile transactions.
