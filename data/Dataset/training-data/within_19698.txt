NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A human rights watchdog group on Tuesday accused Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) of complicity in human rights abuses along a natural gas pipeline in Myanmar in which it holds a stake and said Chevron could be sued.EarthRights International claimed in a report issued on Tuesday that Myanmar's army has in recent years committed serious abuses including rape and murder while providing security for the pipeline that moves gas from the Yadana gas field, located offshore in the Andaman Sea.

Accusations of human rights violations along the pipeline are not new. In 2005, shortly before Chevron announced plans to buy it, Unocal settled a lawsuit brought by Burmese villagers who claimed they had been abused. Activists at EarthRights International served as counsel for the villagers in that case. "ACCESS TO BIG EARS" Companies working on the Yadana project invited a group called Collaborative for Development Action (CDA) to inspect the pipeline region for human rights violations.

EarthRights International said its report was the result of more than 70 interviews as well as informal contacts. Chevron said it strongly disagreed with the report. "The allegations of human rights abuses associated with the project are baseless," spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said in a statement. Yadana "helps meet the energy needs of people in the region, supports critical health, education and infrastructure programs, and serves as a positive influence in the country," he said, adding that third-party audits have touted the benefits of community engagement programs along the pipeline.

Mary Anderson, president of CDA, said CDA has been told in hundreds of interviews with villagers, diplomats and others that forced labor generally does not occur in the pipeline corridor because the company stops it if it does. "The company has access to the big ears," she said. "One phone call and they can make it stop." Asked to comment on EarthRights claims that it has interviewed villagers who have fled the region because of abuse, Anderson said, "One would have to assume that it is still going on in places, but if anything it is far less inside the (pipeline) corridor than outside the corridor." EarthRights has called on Chevron and the other oil and gas companies in Myanmar to suspend ongoing projects, stop development of new ones and refuse to sell gas that funds the military government.

It also has recommended that companies working on the Yadana project stop using the Myanmar military as security and use their influence with the government to press for human rights advances. The group left open the possibility of a lawsuit, saying settlement of the previous lawsuit does not protect Chevron from lawsuits from other plaintiffs from Myanmar.
