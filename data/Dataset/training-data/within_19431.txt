NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The worst is over for U.S. stocks and they are poised to head higher, boosted by the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate cuts and spending linked to the government's economic stimulus package, a leading equity strategist said on Tuesday.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist and chairman of the investment policy committee at Standard & Poor's, reiterated a forecast by his firm calling for the benchmark S&P 500  .SPX  to finish 2008 at 1,560, about 5 points shy of the index's record close set in October 2007.

"We're convinced we'll see good earnings recovery in 2008. Maybe it might not end up being as robust as low to mid-teens but we believe we will be on the recovery track from the 6 percent decline in earnings experienced last year," said Stovall. Also as many companies in the financial sector have taken write-downs for losses stemming from the mortgage meltdown, some of those write-downs are likely to prove to have been unnecessary, Stovall said, meaning they would be "added back to earnings and so as a result we could see by the end of the year an improvement in the overall earnings picture." On sector picks, Stovall said his team is gravitating toward cyclical plays and has begun paring back from its defensive leanings.

"Right now we have an overweight recommendation on consumer staples and materials, but we recently upgraded our recommendations on the cyclical areas -- consumer discretionary, financials, and technology -- to market weight from underweight; and we recently underweighted health care and utilities." The Fed has cut its benchmark lending rate 3 percentage points since mid-September to 2.25 percent.

"We do have a good likelihood of retracing our steps at least up to the 1,560 level," he told an investment outlook teleconference. The target implies a projected 13.1 percent increase for the S&P 500 index from its current level of around 1,380. "Much of the decline we've experienced is likely over in our opinion.

We believe the worst is over and we could see the market work its way higher." Although the U.S. economy will likely enter recession in the first half of 2008, the downturn, he said, will likely be "milder" and similar to the 1990 recession. The recent market pullback, he said, will come down in history as "a very sharp correction but not (the start of) a new bear market." Stovall said his optimism on the outlook for stocks reflects both the Fed's aggressive moves to cut interest rates and "how quickly Congress passed the tax stimulus package, which we believe will serve as a sugar rush for many consumers." Even if the U.S. economy enters a recession, the rest of the world will not likely suffer a similar fate, underpinning prospects for exports to fuel corporate profitability, he told the teleconference.
