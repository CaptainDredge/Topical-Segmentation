He predicted existing funds will be liquidated sometime in the next five years due to the lack of new BABs issuance. So far in December, issuers have sold nearly $14 billion of BABs, compared to $8.1 billion in all of December 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data. This year they have sold $115.4 billion, and over the life of the program they have brought more than $180 billion of BABs to market.

"I hope they don't do any of that," said Maury Fertig, chief investment officer at Relative Value Partners in Northbrook, Illinois. "If people want to do that, they put their money in other places. You want them in a pure form." Fertig, whose firm handles assets for wealthy individuals, said he expects BABs ETFs to sometimes trade at discounts to the value of the bonds in the funds, but that the discounts would likely be short-lived.

MIAMI  (Reuters) - Exchange traded funds launched to tap investors' increasing demand for Build America Bonds may have to change their stripes now that what may be the last BABs are coming to market.Since BABs were created in early 2009's U.S. stimulus program as a way to help state and local governments build roads and other infrastructure, investment houses such as PIMCO have launched ETFs and other vehicles to hold BABs. Cities and other issuers have been rushing in recent months to sell BABs, whose taxable interest payments are subsidized by the federal government and appeal to pension funds, foreign investors and others with little need for the domestic tax savings offered by the $2.8 trillion traditional muni market.

Authority to sell BABs runs out on December 31 after an extension for the program failed to make it into the tax bill passed by Congress this week. In addition to ETFs for BABs, financial firms have created mutual funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts for BABs. "The problems the ETFs face are liquidity and the ability to issue more shares," said Jim Colby, municipals strategist at Van Eck Global, a provider of ETFs. "You could change the index to allow greater flexibility or add other taxable bonds." Managers of the BABs ETFs might possibly convert their entities to closed-end funds or create a hybrid vehicle to allow other types of assets into the ETFs, Colby said.

Invesco Power Shares Build America Bond Portfolio, the first BABs ETF launched 13 months ago, was off 1 cent on Friday at $24.97. The Pimco Build America Bond Strategy Fund was up 3 cents to $47.73. Troy Willis, a vice president and portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Rochester Funds, said his group did not launch any BABs funds due to the lack of clarity on the program's future.
