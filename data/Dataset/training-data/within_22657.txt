But the St. Louis-based brewer left the door open to a higher bid, which Gilpin said would be even more compelling to Anheuser investors, whose shares have languished for five years. "The only thing that concerns me is that the deal goes through fast and I get my money," said Stephen Jarislowsky, chairman and CEO of Jarislowsky, Fraser Ltd.

"I think $70 is still a good deal for InBev and its shareholders," Stirling said. "A lot depends on the scale of savings they can achieve and the coupon on the debt. I think $75 would have been too much." Pirko said $70 was a fair price for Anheuser, which owns half of Mexico's Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ) and 27 percent of China's Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd ( 600600.SS ), though he guessed there were Anheuser insiders who believe the brewer could hold out for more.

As it sweetened its offer, InBev, which brews Stella Artois and Beck's, also moved to quash concerns over its financing by launching a $45 billion syndicated loan backing the proposed takeover, banking sources told Reuters LPC on Friday. The sources said the loan's pricing and fees were among the highest seen on an investment-grade acquisition loan, making this a "must-do deal" for banks, which have been hurt as credit market turmoil has stymied the flow of deals.

The two brewers had grown increasingly contentious since Anheuser rejected the initial bid two weeks ago, with InBev seeking to replace Anheuser's board and Anheuser suing InBev for making "false and misleading statements." Helping to push the two sides to the negotiating table are signs that some big investors in Anheuser, including second-largest shareholder Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ), were leaning toward backing a deal with InBev, according to a report in The New York Times.

Anheuser shares closed up 8.6 percent, or $5.29, at $66.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. In Brussels, InBev shares closed up 7.4 percent at 44.50 euros.
