A source with knowledge of the matter said the cuts would affect so-called voice brokers in London, brokers that deal with clients over the phone, and electronic traders in New York. "They are targeting those desks that are hemorrhaging cash, such as credit derivatives," said one source close to the firm.

"I'd be surprised if there were fewer people on aggregate working at ICAP in a year," Spencer said on a call last month. A source said on Friday that ICAP had started a new risk arbitrage desk in New York with about eight people, including three or four traders. Risk arbitrage seeks to exploit differences in pricing in events likes mergers and acquisitions.

NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - ICAP ( IAP.L ) is cutting up to 100 staff in London and New York, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as the world's largest derivatives broker aims to drive down costs by 50 million pounds ($77.5 million) this year.The cuts could affect up to 70 people in the firm's London office, sources said.

ICAP declined to comment on the job cuts. The financial industry, from investment banks to inter-dealer broker, is struggling to maintain revenues at a time when trading volumes have dwindled and deal-making has dropped off in highly volatile and uncertain markets. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) trimmed staff in its U.S. operations on Thursday amid a slowdown in capital markets activity, three people familiar with the matter said.

The investment bank cut several dozen jobs, the sources said. "All the inter-dealer brokers have suffered as voice broker compensation ratios have crept up as trading volumes have declined," said Richard Perrott, an analyst at Berenberg Bank. "The IDBs have continued to expand since 2008 but revenue per broker is down 20 percent since then - it was inevitable there would be some retrenchment," he said.
