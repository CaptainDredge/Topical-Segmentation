"The ECB would make very clear it will stay on the market," the second official said. Separately, the 440 billion euro EFSF will seek to get more bang for its buck on the primary and secondary markets to turn investor sentiment back in favor of Italian and Spanish paper. This, policymakers hope, would prevent the third and fourth largest euro zone economies from running into financing problems that could prove too big for the euro zone to handle.

Additionally the EU should talk with the IMF about further cooperation," the third official said. The second official explained that the EFSF would guarantee the first 20-30 percent of losses investors might suffer if they bought the bonds of Italy or Spain at a primary auction and the sovereigns later defaulted.

The EFSF would also commit to pay capital to the SPV through a subordinated loan. Against this capital the new SPV would then borrow money on the market and use the cash to buy bonds of Italy or Spain on the secondary market. In case of a default of one of the pair, the EFSF would be the first liable to cover the losses.

"There are only two models which are getting more detailed now. The first is the insurance scheme, the second is an SPV of the EFSF, into which third parties could pay in," a third euro zone source said. "In the end, a mixture of the two models could be decided on.

To support the secondary market, the EFSF would create a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with private investors, sovereign wealth funds or other institutions, perhaps the International Monetary Fund, who would contribute paid-in capital. With the twin measures, a two-tier bond market with primary issuance insured, and existing bonds not, would be avoided.
