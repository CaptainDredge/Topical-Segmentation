The lender said the TBW deal was terminated as the parties failed to get necessary regulatory approvals by the July 31 deadline. Fitch, which downgraded Colonial's long-term issuer rating to CCC from B-minus, lowered it further on Friday to C. Colonial, which posted its fifth straight quarterly loss, also said it was uncertain whether it would be able to maintain capital levels for its Colonial Bank unit, as ordered by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corp (FDIC) and the state of Alabama.

(Reuters) - Colonial BancGroup Inc CNB.N said a pending $300 million crucial investment by Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Co has been terminated, raising doubts on the company's ability to continue as a going concern.The struggling lender, which was earlier issued a cease-and-desist order by the regulators, also said it was exploring strategic capital alternatives, including a sale or merger of the company.

Last month, Colonial's banking unit agreed to a cease-and-desist order with regulators, requiring the bank to increase capital levels and reduce problem assets, among other things. The company said it engaged Citigroup Global Markets Inc as its financial adviser and has held private management meetings with potential strategic acquisition candidates and private equity investment firms.

For the second quarter, the company posted a net loss of $606 million, or $3.02 a share. Shares of the Montgomery, Alabama-based company were down 13 percent at 53 cents in after-hours trade. They closed at 61 cents Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Brenton Cordeiro  and Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore; Editing Pradeep Kurup, Vinu Pilakkott)

An investment by the group led by TBW would have helped the company get the much-needed $550 million capital from the U.S. Treasury. Colonial was mandated to raise $300 million in equity from the private sector in order to get funds from the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, for which the capital-strapped company already received preliminary approval.
