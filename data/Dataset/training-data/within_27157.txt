A new financial architecture for the years ahead. Sometimes it does take a crisis for people to agree that what is obvious and should have been done years ago can no longer be postponed. But we must now create the right new financial architecture for the global age." "With the same courage and foresight of their founders, we must now reform the international financial system around agreed principles of transparency, integrity, responsibility, good housekeeping and cooperation across borders.

LONDON  (Reuters) - Highlights from British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's speech on the world's financial system at the London offices of Thomson Reuters:GLOBAL SUPERVISION "This crisis demonstrates beyond doubt that a global capital market requires much stronger global cooperation and supervision.

This work is important for building confidence and this work must start today.

"And just as we need new global coordination to deal with the waves of change that are defining the new global age from energy supply to climate change, so we need enhanced global cooperation to monitor and then supervise financial flows that know no borders." INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION "The global financial system is too clouded with opacity, conflicts of interest, irresponsible risk taking, and when problems occur countries have tended to look inwards and deal with them in isolation when it is clear they should look outwards and join in international cooperation." "This cannot simply be a short term rescue to paper over the cracks.
