(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch tapped Wall Street Journal managing editor Robert Thomson, a close confidant with little experience on the business side of publishing, as Chief Executive of his new publishing company, which will retain the News Corp name.Thomson's appointment coincided with several other announcements related to the impending publishing company spin-off, including the closing of The Daily, the heavily-hyped digital newspaper for Apple Inc's iPad, and the naming of other key executives.

News Corp did not disclose any financial details related to the spin off, such as how much cash and debt will be ascribed to the new publishing company, or appoint a board of directors. Also absent from Monday's announcement was any mention of Lachlan Murdoch, Rupert's eldest son, who News Corp watchers and industry experts thought might be recruited back into the family business, given his previous success as publisher of the New York Post.

His ascension comes at a difficult time for print media. Newspapers face tough challenges as advertisers look elsewhere and people increasingly prefer smartphones and tablets to ink and paper. While Thomson, a native Australian, is a long time newspaper executive, including U.S. editor of the Financial Times and editor of the Times of London, his experience has been mostly in the newsroom.

"Many of you know that a belief in the power of the written word has been in my bones for my entire life," Murdoch, News Corp's chairman, wrote in a memo to employees obtained by Reuters. "I witnessed the hunger people had for well-written, thoroughly observed stories ... stories that provide not just information, but insight.

Indeed, News Corp named former MGM Studios president Bedi Ajay Singh as the publishing unit's chief financial officer on Monday. However, by keeping the News Corp name for the publishing company and by choosing Thomson, Murdoch is selecting a trusted editorial lieutenant to tend to the medium that played a leading role in building his empire and is closest to his heart.
