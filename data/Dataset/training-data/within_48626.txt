GE executives have said their first priorities for that cash pile are to buy back the preferred stake in the company sold to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) and boosting the dividend, which the company slashed by 68 percent during the credit crunch. The company does not expect to lay out much of its cash for big acquisitions.

Those factors will determine the heading of the company's shares, which have more than tripled from the 18-year low they touched in March 2009, despite what is expected to be the company's ninth straight quarter of profit declines. "What's the trajectory of this year versus last year at GE Capital? My sense is that things are going better than what the company thought back in December," said Daniel Holland, equity analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.

Its shares have risen about 65 percent over the past year, outpacing the 36 percent rise of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI . About 10 percent of GE's recent rise has come in the last month, which could suggest investors' hopes have risen. Shares of fellow blue chip Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) fell more than 2 percent on Tuesday after the aluminum producer posted quarterly revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations.

"One of the reasons that we've stuck with them is the stability of the services revenue," said John Dowling, portfolio manager at Golub Group, a San Mateo, California-based company that oversees about $660 million in assets, including GE shares. "Eventually we'll see the new equipment orders come back, but it's been the service revenue that has kept us comfortable." One key remaining risk is how much additional money the conglomerate will have to pump into its GE Capital finance arm in the coming years.

SERVICES KEY Like its sometime rival United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), GE has counted on its services business -- the revenue it generates for repairing and maintaining the railroad locomotives, CT-scan machines and other heavy equipment it sells -- to smooth results through the downturn. Investors will be watching closely to see if that service revenue held steady in the first quarter.
