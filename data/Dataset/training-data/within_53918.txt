However, whenever possible, supervision and regulation should be the first line of defense against potential threats to financial stability." BERNANKE ON REGULATORY IMPROVEMENTS "To facilitate swifter, more-effective supervisory responses, we have increased the degree of centralization of the oversight and control of our supervisory function, with shared accountability by senior Board and Reserve Bank supervisory staff and active oversight by the Board of Governors.

And none of those folks have been known for timidity in previous episodes in terms of trying to find ways to prevent a worsening of the financial crisis and what I heard from them was just a sense of defeat, this is just way too big a hole. My own view is that it's very likely that the company was insolvent even, not just illiquid." BERNANKE ON FINANCIAL INNOVATIONS "I think one of the lessons of the crisis is that innovation is not always a good thing." "The new financial stability oversight council, for example, ought to pay close attention to financial innovations, and regulators, as we look at risk managements and systemic consequences of these decisions, need to be assertive if there are developments that we find either counterproductive from the perspective of consumer protection or systemically risky." BERNANKE: LENDING TO LEHMAN WOULD HAVE BROKEN LAW "The only way we could have saved Lehman would have been by breaking the law and I'm not sure I'm willing to accept those consequences for the Federal Reserve and for our system of laws.

I believe that in a much different way than we did before the crisis, we now have the tools to address that. "In particular tougher regulation and oversight will reduce the risks. The existence of a resolution regime will increase market discipline because creditors will know they can lose money. Strengthening the resilience of the financial system itself will reduce the incentive of the government to intervene in these situations." BERNANKE ON PRESSURES ON FIRMS TO DOWNSIZE "My projection is that even without direct intervention by the government, that over time we're going to see some break up and some reduction in size and complexity of some of these firms as they respond to the incentives created by market pressures and by regulatory pressures as well." FROM PREPARED TEXT: BERNANKE ON TOO BIG TO FAIL "If the crisis has a single lesson, it is that the too-big-to-fail problem must be solved.

Thus, a promise not to intervene in and of itself will not solve the problem. "The new financial reform law and current negotiations on new Basel capital and liquidity regulations have together set into motion a three-part strategy to address too-big-to-fail." BERNANKE ON USING MONETARY POLICY AGAINST ASSET BUBBLES "Generally, financial regulation and supervision, rather than monetary policy, provide more-targeted tools for addressing credit-related problems.

Simple declarations that the government will not assist firms in the future, or restrictions that make providing assistance more difficult, will not be credible on their own. Few governments will accept devastating economic costs if a rescue can be conducted at a lesser cost; even if one administration refrained from rescuing a large, complex firm, market participants would believe that others might not refrain in the future.
