International same-store sales rose 5.4 percent. Domino's also said its ability to draw upon its variable funding notes has been reduced after Lehman Brothers, the primary provider of those funding notes, declared bankruptcy. Domino's said it is looking for alternate sources of funding. The pizza chain operator noted that it has no borrowings under its available variable funding notes as of September 7.

It has also added oven-baked sandwiches to its menu in a bid to lift sluggish U.S. sales. In the fiscal third quarter, which ended September 7, the company's net profit fell 8 percent to $10.1 million, or 17 cents per share, from $11 million, or 17 cents per share a year earlier.

Like other pizza sellers, Domino's has faced weak domestic demand and higher costs for items like wheat and cheese. At the same time, U.S. consumers are more likely to prepare their own meals at home to save money. The company, which competes with Papa John's International Inc ( PZZA.O ) and Yum Brands Inc's ( YUM.N ) Pizza Hut chain, has been replacing underperforming store operators and cautiously raising prices to cover higher food costs.

The company's chief executive warned that improving its fortunes in a sputtering U.S. economy would be "very tough." "Our operators face the powerful forces of high commodity prices, consumers who are reluctant to spend, and a credit crunch that has slowed domestic new store growth, reinvestment in stores and our ability to expedite the turnover of poor-performing franchisees," CEO David Brandon said in a statement.

Domino's said its ongoing cash flow from operations and the estimated $21.7 million available under the variable funding notes facility is enough to fund its operations for the foreseeable future. "We believe 'cash is king' in today's uncertain market conditions," Brandon said. Domino's said its free cash flow was $25.8 million in the first three quarters of 2008.
