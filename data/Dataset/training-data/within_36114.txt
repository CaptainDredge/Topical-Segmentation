NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Intel Corp posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit but said uncertainty in global economic conditions made it difficult to predict product demand, and its shares fell 4 percent.The world's largest chip maker refrained from giving a formal revenue forecast for the second quarter, but said it was planning for revenue to be roughly flat with the first quarter.

The problem with that is that for Q2 we'd expected some improvement and we're not seeing that improvement based on their guidance." "The question is, is management being conservative. Especially with the CEO talking about PC sales bottoming out. So if we're bottoming out in the first quarter, and we're talking about revenue being flat in the second quarter, is that just being conservative?"

with this guidance you are left wondering whether gross margins are rising, flat, or even down next quarter." "The results are impressive if you just look at 11 cents in a quarter where people were concerned whether Intel would make a profit at all. Unfortunately some of that came from much lower taxes...half of the good news came from lower tax rates." ANDY NG, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "It's surprising that they again didn't provide guidance.

Maybe we bounce along the bottom here, but we're not seeing a rollover." DOUG FREEDMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BROADPOINT AMTECH "I think the outlook people are looking at with a little bit of disappointment in that they are not giving us a lot of clarity. Again they have not given us a revenue number citing uncertainty and limited visibility." "They continue to be very vague on guidance and the stock tends to be driven by gross margins ...
