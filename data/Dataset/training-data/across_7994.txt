LONDON  (Reuters) - Gus O'Donnell, widely seen as a front runner to become chairman at scandal-hit bank Barclays ( BARC.L ), is out of the running for the job after senior bankers raised concerns about the former top civil servant's lack of industry experience.The Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain's financial watchdog, the FSA, would have probably turned down the application if Barclays' board had chosen O'Donnell, a former UK Cabinet Secretary, because of a lack of experience.

Adding customers to the instant-streaming business is crucial to the company's future as it moves away from mailing DVDs in its signature red envelopes.

The guidance did not, however, address a separate concern by the industry about potential tax and record-keeping burdens that could arise from a floating NAV, though the SEC has previously said that the IRS is expected to come up with a fix. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators created by the Dodd-Frank reform law, had asked the IRS late last year to look into the tax concerns raised by the fund industry, as part of a broader proposal calling for reforms to the money market fund industry.
