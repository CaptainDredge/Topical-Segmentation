DETROIT  (Reuters) - German carmaker Daimler AG's ( DAIGn.DE ) premium division Mercedes-Benz Cars achieved another 10 percent in cost efficiencies in 2007 after a 12 percent productivity gain in 2006, Mercedes Chief Operating Officer Rainer Schmueckle told Reuters.He said in an interview on Monday that the division wanted to have another 10 percent to 15 percent in efficiencies, measured in production hours per vehicle, in the next three years on a cumulative basis.

Mercedes has four avenues for reducing CO2 emissions that will lead to reducing fuel use to 5.5 liters per 100 km (43 miles per gallon) by 2012/2015 from 7 liters on average now. He said all engines would have direct injection and better heat management, while the trend was to make engines smaller and add hybrid versions.

Raw material buying costs were reduced 7.5 percent to 8 percent over the period 2006-2007 and he expected further gains from purchasing practices over the next three years while the cost cuts due to Mercedes' new plan for modular car design would start to kick in from 2010. The modular system means that each new car is designed using common modules -- air conditioning or engines -- instead of using many separate parts.

While direct injection costs hundreds of euros per car, a hybrid engine would cost an extra 2,500 to 4,000 euros ($3,717 to $5,947) per car depending on the volumes. Schmueckle said EU plans to reduce CO2 emissions were expected but he said Mercedes was surprised by Brussels' proposed price penalty of 95 euros ($141.2) per gram of CO2.

The aim was to define 100 modules -- 50 have been finalized and the other half will be put in place in the next 1-1/2 years. Schmueckle said Mercedes would decide in 2008 about a possible East European plant for additional capacity for the smaller A- and B-Class vehicle. "In that sector you have to be competitive on costs," he said.
