Disappointing results over the past two quarters have marred Sullivan's previous track record of posting profits in every period since he became CEO in 2005. Now, analysts say Sullivan must work to stem losses, shore up capital, and regain investors confidence, which has fallen as potential losses from credit swaps have ballooned.

But Steve Bensinger, who is stepping aside as chief financial officer to assume another role at AIG, said "we continue to believe that a market-based analysis is not the best methodology (for) potential realized losses." AIG's credit default swaps essentially insured subprime mortgage bonds and other assets against default. RATINGS BLOW The one-notch downgrades by Standard & Poor's and Fitch followed AIG's Thursday loss announcement.

Sullivan told investors the downgrade was "manageable." "Importantly, both agencies kept the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries at the "AA-plus" level, which is most important to us," Sullivan added. While AIG is raising capital and working to stem losses, investors have been hopeful that there would be an improvement in the mortgage market that could boost AIG's results as early as the second quarter.

But Bensinger, who is assuming the role of vice-chairman of financial services, told investors that he does not yet see signs of a recovery in the structured credit market for residential mortgage securities, including subprime. "We don't see any precise evidence to date that those markets have rebounded," said Bensinger. The company has said it expects much of the costly revaluation of its credit swaps to reverse over time, as market conditions improve.

NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group ( AIG.N ), after disappointing with a worse-than-expected loss on Thursday, did little to buoy investor spirits on Friday, telling shareholders it does not yet see signs of a rebound in the market for mortgage assets, which have cost it dearly over the past two quarters.AIG posted a $7.8 billion first-quarter loss, surpassing the then-record $5.3 billion loss it posted in the fourth quarter, largely stemming from a decline in the value of assets linked to subprime mortgages.
