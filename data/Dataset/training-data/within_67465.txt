Tougher regulation has added pressure to shrink balance sheets and exit some business areas. That has put more scrutiny on costs, which are seen as particularly high at Switzerland's top two banks. "Especially under new regulations, the only way to improve return on equity is to cut costs," said Shailesh Raikundlia, analyst at MF Global in London.

Banks are slimming down as weak investment trading this year looks set to continue, leaving many carrying high costs after hiring aggressively in 2009 and early 2010 when trading income surged following the financial crisis. "Since UBS announced their 2 billion franc cost saving initiative, the economic environment has deteriorated even further, making these plans seem inadequate," Helvea analyst Peter Thorne said.

UBS, which had to be rescued by the state in 2008 after massive losses on toxic assets, slashed staff to around 64,000 from 78,000 before the financial crisis, but it grew again in the last year to over 65,700. Around 45 percent of the cuts will come from UBS's investment bank, 35 percent from wealth management & Swiss bank, 10 percent from global asset management and 10 percent from wealth management Americas.

Client advisers at the bank's wealth management unit will not be affected by the cuts. A spokeswoman for UBS declined to give any further breakdown of where the job cuts would come, saying all areas would be affected and that the focus would be on middle and back office staff. Investment banks worldwide have been hit by slow trading due to the debt problems in the euro zone and United States, as well as regulations aimed at forcing banks to hold more capital to protect them from future shocks after the 2008 global financial crisis.

It had already said it would cut jobs when it posted weak second quarter profits last month as its underperforming fixed income business weighed. Like rival Credit Suisse Group AG ( CSGN.VX ), UBS has been grappling with rising regulatory costs and a red-hot Swiss franc, which are eating into profits.
