But Fiat thinks it will need billions to make the GM deal work. Facing competition from Austrian-Canadian parts maker Magna for Opel, Fiat makes public its proposal for the operation this week. Germany's government, which faces elections in September, is also pressing hard to avoid plant closures. Part of the problem for Pomigliano is that fuel-efficient models which have driven Fiat's recovery -- earning praise from U.S. President Barack Obama -- are mainly produced overseas.

Meanwhile, the official unemployment rate in the south runs at three times the north's rate, at over 12 percent, making a regular job a dream for many young Italians here.

PROMISE NOT TO SACK Berlusconi, a media tycoon whose approval ratings have so far survived the downturn, has unveiled 1.7 billion euros of incentives to stimulate the auto sector which accounts for 11 percent of gross domestic product and 380,000 jobs. Like others in Europe, his government has promised cash -- up to 1,500 euros -- for Italians to trade in their old cars for new, greener models, but it said the scheme relied on a promise from Fiat not to close any plants.
