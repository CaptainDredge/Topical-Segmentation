The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: MICHAEL HOLLAND, PRESIDENT OF HOLLAND & CO IN NEW YORK "No surprise they're trading off a bit this morning, was concerned they couldn't continue the stretch of Goldman. "0verall there is no other way to describe it than positive." "We have a really ugly economic backdrop that these companies are faced with, jobless etc, those numbers aren't going to go away soon." "I hope in the conference call they talk about what they're doing with top performing people in terms of compensation." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST AT MILLER TABAK & CO IN NEW YORK "I think that what Bank of America, GE, IBM and Mattel all show is good earnings, relative to expectations, but revenue is missing guidance and expectations.

Ultimately, with this we will wait and see what happens to Citi. But I don't think these results on their own are going to help lift equities this afternoon." "I just don't think they are having the same impact as the big numbers from Goldman Sachs did."

"So far, earnings season is good, but if you were to call it revenue season it'd be more of a mixed bag. What this shows is that companies are able to deal with cost structure, but that the revenue is light shows that we're still in a difficult economic environment. "The Dow is up  a lot this week, and with it being expiration day, I wouldn't be surprised if the market took a breather, especially after such a strong start to the week." PHILIP GILLETT, SALES TRADER AT IG INDEX, LONDON "The (BofA) results look better, but that's in large part due to cost cutting as they've lost baggage, which just shows they were rather flabby before." PAUL MILLER, ANALYST, FBR CAPITAL MARKETS "They look good on the top line but the growth in losses continue to really concern me.
