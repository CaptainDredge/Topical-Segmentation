Finland escaped a negative outlook partly because of its small and domestically oriented banking system, its fiscally conservative budget policies and its limited trade links with the rest of the euro area, Moody's said. Moody's also cited Finland's efforts to reduce its exposure to potential loan losses in bailouts of euro area sovereigns.

that policymakers could only contain at a very high cost." It also warned that Germany and other countries rated 'Aaa' might have to increase support for troubled states such as Spain and Italy that are struggling to finance their deficits. The burden of that support would fall most heavily on the euro zone's top-rated states, it said.
