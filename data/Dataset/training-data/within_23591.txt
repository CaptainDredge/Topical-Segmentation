NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hartford Financial Services Group Inc's ( HIG.N ) earnings fell in the second quarter, hurt by a surge in claims from tornado damage and lower investment returns, but the results still beat Wall Street expectations.Hartford, a large life and property-casualty insurer, said on Monday that operating earnings fell 9 percent to $696 million, or $2.22 a share.

On that basis, analysts on average expected the company to earn $2.10 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The insurer said it still expects between $9.20 and $9.50 a share in operating earnings in 2008. Goldman Sachs analyst Tom Cholnoky, in a research note, said Hartford beat expectations with stronger than expected results in both its property-casualty, and life divisions.
