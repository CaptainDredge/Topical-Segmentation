Lewis said the rescue package will help it operate as normally as possible. The bank said it had extended more than $115 billion in new loans in the quarter and was adding mortgage staff to accommodate more refinancings. "This company will generate huge amounts of profit" when the economy returns to normal, Lewis said.
