Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) said its Sandoz generics unit was cooperating but the main branded drugs unit was not implicated. The Commission said the probe followed concerns competition was not functioning properly and it highlighted the fact that the number of innovative drugs had decreased in recent years. The raids will help establish if companies created barriers to competitors, whether they misused patent rights or engaged in "vexatious litigation" and if some firms abused their dominance of the market.

Kroes said the aim was to ensure governments and consumers got more new products and value for money. She said Europeans spent around 200 billion euros ($300 billion) annually on pharmaceuticals, or about 400 euros for each person. "If innovative products are not being produced, and cheaper generic alternatives to existing products are in some cases being delayed, then we need to find out why and, if necessary, take action," she said in the statement.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations said it hoped the inquiry would enable the Commission to better understand the importance of intellectual property rights in driving drug innovation. The EU executive expects to announce preliminary results late this year and make a complete report in the spring of 2009.

AstraZeneca and other firms involved with the new investigation said they were cooperating fully with officials. Other companies, including Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ), Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ) and Bayer Schering Pharma BAYG.DE said they were not aware that they were involved or had not received inquiries from officials.

Mike Ward, an industry analyst at stockbroker Nomura Code, said the probe highlighted the pressure on drugmakers worldwide to prove their patent maneuvers were above board. "There have been mutterings in the United States as well, particularly with regards to deals that have been struck by companies to keep certain generics off the market," he said.
