Without reforming a dysfunctional state, there was little hope for a long-term solution to Greece's problems. "Any defections will be minor and Venizelos will be triumphant on Thursday but it will be a Pyrrhic victory," he said. "However well the duet performs, there remains the chaos of the Greek state beneath them." POLITICAL ROYALTY Papandreou is the son and grandson of famous prime ministers.

Venizelos is already meeting and trying to dissuade deputies who have threatened to vote against the fresh set of austerity measures. If the plan is rejected, Greece will not get the next, crucial 12 billion euro ($17.2 billion) tranche of a 110 billion euro bailout it won last year from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.

A sociologist born in the United States, he likes dabbling in international diplomacy and still speaks the faltering Greek of the Hellenic diaspora. He has held the Education and Foreign Affairs portfolios. Affable and mellow, he loves to talk about his vision for "green growth," of turning Greece into an environmentally-friendly economic paradise, even in the middle of the worst crisis in nearly four decades.

Venizelos, the son of a provincial lawyer from the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, has bruiser looks that belie one of the sharpest intellects in Greek politics. A law professor and one of Greece's top constitutional experts, he is famous for his rhetoric -- as government spokesman in the 1990s he reveled in verbal fencing with journalists.

Papandreou is a soft-spoken, athletic 59-year-old who is comfortable in the corridors of Brussels. Venizelos, 54, is a stocky party stalwart who can easily bully rogue members of parliament. "We have two prime ministers," far right LAOS leader George Karatzaferis told parliament after the June 17 reshuffle that thrust Venizelos into the Finance Ministry hot seat.
