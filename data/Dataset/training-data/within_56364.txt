The situation of course cannot remain as it is now, leading to such volatility which is not of course welcome." ON NON-TRADITIONAL MEASURES ECB policies are of course dictated by the general situation in the euro area....you have also observed that in spite of the Irish banking sector problems, total liquidity provided by the ECB has been decreasing since June.

VIENNA  (Reuters) - Following are comments by European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio at a news conference in Vienna on Monday.SHOULD IRELAND BE ENCOURAGED TO ACCEPT EU AID? "In the first place, it's a decision of the Irish authorities. They will have to put forward a request. We cannot prejudge what they will do." "I will nevertheless underline that the financing needs are not only related to the government, because there you mentioned that the Irish state is financed until part of next year, but it is also a problem of the banks that are at the center of the problems in Ireland and considerations have to be pondered." "But as I said it's up to the Irish authorities to decide if and when they think they need the help of the European Financial Stability Facility." "It is available, and the situation of Ireland has been examined and studied by all the involved entities in Europe so I would say the instrument is ready and now it's up to the Irish authorities." "Yes, of course (I would back an Irish request for EU aid).

The necessary policies should be adjusted to maintain that target." PORTUGAL SITUATION "There are contagion effects of course that are going on in general. In any case, Portugal has announced that it does not need to tap the markets until the end of the year at least and perhaps the initial months of next year also." "So that also has to be considered, and in the case of Portugal there are no pressure coming from the banking system, as in the case of Ireland.

ON STEPPING UP BOND PURCHASES "That is a matter for further consideration, but as you know we don't precommit or even announce the type of policy that we pursue with the Securities Market Programme." "You only have after each week the total amount that has been used, as you have seen that is according to developments in the market, in particular in passing a judgment on whether such developments can have some economic justification in the fundamentals of the economy or not." "The program is still there and you have seen that in the more recent weeks in view of developments we have used a little bit more than in recent months." ON GREECE "There are two elements there (Greece)...in the first place the results for this year are in big part the result of the fact that the deficit of 2009 has been revised up." "It is an automatic result that this makes it more difficult to achieve the target that was fixed when the deficit for 2009 was thought to be low." "Even if the policies had been totally in line with what was foreseen initially, in the end the deficit would be higher because the starting point was worse than was known at the time..." "What is essential, and we are really expecting that Greece will comply, is for them to maintain the same target for next year, which may involve certainly new policies that were not perhaps contemplated before." "In spite of what happened this year, the target for next year should be kept.

Those two aspects also have to be considered." ARE MARKETS OVERREACTING AT THE MOMENT? "We all know that markets tend to overshoot. We all know that. It is in a way normal behavior when certain perceptions crystallize...and it is acting here." "In a way it was to be expected when these situations crystallize that there is overshooting...They are volatile trying to see what will be the final outcome and the final response to the problem because a response is necessary.
