The Basel Committee, made up of banking supervisors from nearly 30 countries, is under pressure to meet a December deadline for revamping the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). "We will have to agree to agree. There is too much at stake," a European regulatory source said of the meeting. PHASED INTRODUCTION The rule as originally drafted required banks to hold a buffer of mainly highly rated government bonds from 2015 to withstand a 30-day run of customers withdrawing their deposits.

The rest of the buffer, about 40 percent, could be in highly rated corporate debt or cash. Hills said that the BBA expects the Basel Committee to be a little more flexible on the liquidity coverage ratio by allowing assets other than corporate bonds to be included in the minority component of the buffer.

Even if a deal is reached, the globally-agreed January 2013 start date for Basel's capital rules won't be met in Europe, with a delay of up to a year now on the cards. "A pragmatic solution would be to extend the implementation date until the beginning of 2014, rather than doing some parts mid-2013 and the rest six months later," Hills said.

"Hopefully, the meetings next week will make enough progress to give banks the clarity they need to get ready for the new requirements," said Simon Hills, an executive director at the British Bankers' Association (BBA). "They should also reduce the regulatory uncertainty that is so unhelpful to markets and investors making assessments about bank business models and structures to inform their investment decisions," Hills added.

Many of the biggest European and U.S. banks already comply with Basel III's minimum capital requirements of a 7 percent core Tier 1 ratio, a bank's main benchmark of health. But a delay in formal rules would cast doubt on whether banks will provide enough data for regulators to finalize Basel's liquidity rule and leverage ratio in time for 2015.
