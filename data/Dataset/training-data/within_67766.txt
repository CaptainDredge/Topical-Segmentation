They're going to have to be in the market to buy incremental spectrum." "It's mixed for Sprint. On the one hand, they were potentially going to lose T-Mobile USA as a competitor at the low end of the market. Now it's going to face a T-Mobile that's in a better position prior to the merger proposal, with extra cash and spectrum and a new roaming agreement with AT&T." "It also puts T-Mobile USA back in play as a potential merger candidate for Sprint." ANDREW HOGLEY, ESPIRITO SANTO TELECOMS ANALYST "The momentum had been building on the positive case.

It will hurt Sprint, and certainly many of the smaller players. "And since it's astronomically expensive to start a mobile carrier these days, it's unlikely that any new competitors will arise unless a big international funding group steps in -- perhaps from China -- which is unlikely to win approval politically."

HAROLD FELD, PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE LEGAL DIRECTOR "Fighting this job-killing merger is the best Labor Day present anyone can give the American people. AT&T's effort to recreate 'Ma Cell' by holding rural broadband hostage and threatening American jobs deserves nothing but scorn. "The FCC should move as quickly as possible to follow the lead of the Department of Justice and reject the merger." ANDREW SCHWARTZMAN, MEDIA ACCESS PROJECT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND POLICY DIRECTOR "This is arguably the most anti-competitive move in recent American economic history.

A lot of state governors, attorneys-general had been coming out in support of the case. AT&T had been lobbying on creating 5,000 more U.S. jobs, guaranteeing no more call center redundancies. "We thought the weight of AT&T's lobbying was having some success; this very much undermines that. It's very uncertain where this leaves us at the moment.
