RIM co-Chief Executive Jim Balsillie heightened expectations recently by promising major product launches in the year ahead. He told analysts on a conference call that if they saw the company's playbook they would be "blown away". Speculation has centered on RIM unveiling several new handsets at the show, most notably the high-end BlackBerry 9670.

The device, expected to be shaped like a clamshell, could become the first RIM phone to use the new operating system. The company may also use the trade show to launch the long-awaited high-end Bold 9650 and lower-end 3G Pearl. "I want to walk away from this event feeling like these guys do have another high-end product cycle that is worth paying attention to," Avian's Thornton said.

RIM says it is still a contender in the consumer market, but analysts want to hear details about how it plans to win that fight. Its effort to increase the number of apps that run on its phones, for example, is a key part of that strategy and an area where it falls well short of Apple's success.

POSITIVE VIBE BOOSTS STOCK In the past, RIM used the WES event to show off new products and partnerships, generating a positive vibe that has boosted its stock. "In the past three years, WES has been a positive catalyst for RIM's shares, outpacing both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq by 5 percent plus," said Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron in a note to clients.

The Waterloo, Ontario-based company may do this at a full-day analyst meeting on Monday, the day before WES opens. Evidence of the stiff competition that RIM faces was brought into sharp relief on Tuesday when Apple posted blowout results on the back of record iPhone sales. By comparison, RIM reported quarterly profit, revenue, and phone shipments March 31 that came in below market expectations, raising concerns about its prospects.
