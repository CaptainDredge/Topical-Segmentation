IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said last week that the fund was ready to step in, if needed. That said, the former French finance minister is widely reported to be eyeing the French presidential election in 2012 that would pit him against President Nicolas Sarkozy, and riding to Europe's rescue would score political points.

European officials have also been adamant that they want to handle matters themselves. "What's clear is that this is a matter for the Europeans," German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German media this week. "There is no doubt that Greece is not a question for the International Monetary Fund." But there are concerns outside the eurozone that Greece's woes have already harmed the prospects of enlarging the euro zone, dealing a blow to Baltic states' ambitions of joining the eurozone.

The cost of insuring those countries' debt against default has soared in recent days. If the debt situation proves more dire than initially thought, Europe may need the IMF's financial firepower.

He said while the IMF could provide Greece with financial support through a precautionary arrangement, he acknowledged it would be politically easier for the IMF to monitor whether Greece honors its commitments on fiscal reforms through some form of "enhanced surveillance." Such an IMF "seal of approval" would help to reassure markets, Lombardi added.

Turning to the IMF would for many leaders amounts to "capitulation to Washington, a total political abdication," said Paul de Grauwe, economics professor at Belgium's Catholic University of Leuven. But deeper IMF involvement would provide some reassurance to skittish investors who are casting a wary eye toward other fiscally fragile countries such as Spain and Portugal that are also shouldering heavy debt burdens.
