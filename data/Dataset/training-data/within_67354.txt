FATCA also covers affiliates of the entities. Foreign banks object to the rule's applicability to financial instruments including bearer bonds and payments which "pass through" securitization pools, a component of syndicated loans. In June, the European Banking Federation and the Institute of International Bankers, both trade groups, told the U.S. Treasury that forcing banks to track pass-through payments on syndicated loans, swaps, foreign currency trades and routine money transfers "will create stresses in the global financial system, with indeterminate consequences." Euroclear, the world's largest settlement company for bond, equity, derivatives and other transactions, echoed those thoughts.

In an interview, Manal Corwin, Treasury's deputy assistant secretary for International Tax Matters, acknowledged that "we need to provide additional guidance. It's going to define it and refine it." While FATCA envisions institutions turning over client data to the IRS, Corwin said the Treasury was considering alternatives for countries with bank secrecy laws.

Foreign institutions and entities that refuse, or fail, to do so face bills for the taxes due, a draconian penalty of 40 percent of the amount in question and heightened scrutiny by the IRS. "FATCA is a blunt instrument for which foreign banks have no choice but to each spend tens of millions of dollars to help the U.S. enforce its own tax law," said Scott Michel, a tax lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale in Washington, D.C. A senior American finance executive at the Hong Kong branch of a major investment house told Michel that FATCA was "America's most imperialist act since it invaded the Philippine Islands in 1899." The regulation, Michel said, was "engendering a profound and growing anti-American sentiment abroad." Dean Marsan, a tax lawyer and former senior tax counsel at Lehman Brothers who has written extensively on FATCA, called the rule "a U.S.-centric law for the world." The legislation that created FATCA was introduced in 2009 by four congressmen during a crackdown on UBS ( UBSN.VX )( UBS.N ), the Swiss bank giant that sold tax evasion services.

Signed into law by U.S. President Barack Obama in March 2010, FATCA goes into effect on January 1, 2014, for most types of transactions and a year later for other payments. The phase-in, announced in April, already represents a backtracking by the Treasury Department amid criticism from foreign banks about FATCA's reach, costs and still-to-be-ironed-out points.

It originally had planned a January 1, 2013, start date. BACKLASH GROWS In June, the private banking arm of HSBC ( HSBA.L ) said it would stop offering services to U.S. residents outside the United States because of the cost of complying with the rule. That month, Michael Ambuehl, Switzerland's secretary of state for international tax and financial matters, told a conference in Zurich that FATCA showed that "Switzerland is becoming a target of intense international greediness." Even the European Commission has objected, and experts say other countries may create their own FATCA-style regimes for U.S. banks or withdraw from U.S. capital markets.
