NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The manufacturing sector grew in May at its slowest pace in three months as economic trouble overseas dented demand for exports, an industry survey showed on Friday.The final Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index stood at 54.0 in May, above last week's preliminary estimate of 53.9 but below April's reading of 56.0. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson attributed the slowdown to "a near-stagnation of export orders, reflecting deteriorating demand in many overseas markets, notably the euro zone but also emerging markets such as China." Overall, though, manufacturing grew for a 32nd straight month, and the slowdown in exports reduced raw material prices, which Williamson said is good news for the inflation outlook and "should help take some pressure off squeezed profit margins."
