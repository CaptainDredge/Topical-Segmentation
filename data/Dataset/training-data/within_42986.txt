In May, former board member Sean Harrigan resigned as president of the board of the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions fund, citing the SEC delving into his ties to a firm named in New York's pension fund probe. Investigators came across Harrigan because he had been a consultant to a Los Angeles placement agent firm referenced in New York's indictment of Henry Morris, a onetime advisor to former New York Comptroller Alan Hevesi.

"This is a time when investors are under as much scrutiny as companies for mistakes that led to risk-taking and collapses." Calpers and Calstrs, seen as politically savvy and well-run by industry analysts, may also be trying to get ahead of new federal rules expected before the end of the year.

SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON  (Reuters) - Calpers, the biggest U.S. public pension fund, said on Wednesday it is probing fees paid by outside money managers to win its business, expanding a review of "pay-to-play" schemes at public retirement systems that has spread across the nation.The $200 billion fund said in a statement its probe centers around payments of more than $50 million that outside managers made over a five-year period to ARVCO Financial Ventures LLC, a firm headed by former Calpers board member Al Villalobos, who served on the fund's board between 1993 and 1995.

"The placement agent industry has been a focus of state authorities and the Securities and Exchange Commission over the last year, and we believe it prudent to conduct a full review of the matters related to these recent disclosures to us," Calpers Chief Executive Anne Stausboll said in a statement. CLAMPDOWN ON PLACEMENT AGENTS Calpers spokeswoman Pat Macht said its managers reported fees to ARVCO for the following private equity funds: * Apollo Alternative Assets LP * Apollo Credit Opportunities Fund LP * Apollo European Principal Finance Fund LP * Apollo Global Management LLC * Apollo Investment Fund VI LP * Apollo Investment Fund VII LP * Apollo Special Opportunities Managed Account LP * Aurora Equity Partners III LP * Aurora Resurgence Fund (c) LP, and * Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund LP, Macht said the probe is a larger effort at Calpers to tally fees paid to placement agents for its business.

At issue for Calpers is the role Villalobos' firm played as a "placement agent" for investment institutions seeking the fund's business. Villalobos could not be reached for comment. Placement agents have come under increased scrutiny in other states, notably New York and New Mexico, where politically connected individuals have acted as middlemen for investment institutions, particularly private equity funds.
