It looks negative for the crude market but inventory levels are still on the low side, and we would argue that it's more than discounted in the price of crude oil. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is that while some might point to demand for the build in gasoline, there have been pipeline related issues for getting the product to the Southeast." TOM KNIGHT, TRADER, TRUMAN ARNOLD, TEXARKANA, TEXAS: "Although the magnitude of the stock builds in crude and gasoline are sharply higher than expected, I find the latest EIA data showing no particularly big surprise here.

Imports are up sharply, that's what led to the crude stock build. It's kind of surprising because runs are up so much. "Gasoline stocks -- very big build there, I'm surprised at how big of a build there was there as well. You've got refinery margins for gasoline, in many cases, they are negative, so there is no incentive to make gasoline...but demand is down sharply as well, so I'm sure that's part of it."

U.S. crude oil prices tumbled after the release of the data. HIGHLIGHTS FROM EIA REPORT (In million barrels): - Crude +8.1 (forecast +2.3) - Distillate -0.5 (forecast -0.4) - Gasoline +7.2 (forecast +1.1) ANALYST COMMENTS TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST FOR CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE "The big builds in crude and gasoline were the big surprises in this week's data set, but the draw in distillate stocks was smaller than expected as well." PHIL FLYNN, ANALYST, ALARON TRADING, CHICAGO: "Obviously, that's a big crude build.

I think we're going to continue to go back and forth with that." "Already the rate cut and the stock market seem to be overshadowing everything. We definitely sold off after these numbers came out, and now the inventories numbers are old news and we're going to focus again on what the stock market does for the rest of the day." "Big picture, are we concerned about the tight supply?
