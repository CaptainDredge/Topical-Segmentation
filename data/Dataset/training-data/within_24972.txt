Taking into account next year's political changes on Capitol Hill and in the White House, chances for radical change in the next year or two may be remote, some analysts said. The Democratic Party, a long-time ally of the GSEs, is widely expected to keep House of Representatives control next year, while possibly increasing its narrow Senate advantage.

But we do not expect him to propose major changes. This means the odds seem to favor the enterprises returning to the public markets," he said. Paulson's plan calls for Fannie and Freddie to increase their mortgage portfolios to support a recovery in the U.S. housing market through 2009, then gradually reduce their activities by about 10 percent annually in the next decade.

Hours after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under federal conservatorship by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday, housing experts were predicting a struggle next year over the final fate of the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs. "There doesn't seem to be an end-game in this ...

And if they're private entities, that we don't bail them out." McCain economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin on Sunday told Reuters that long-term reforms should "scale down Fannie and Freddie so their size is no longer a threat. And then privatize them. Get them off the taxpayer's books entirely." Congress is unlikely to choose a long-term fix in its few remaining weeks in session in 2008, and the long-term outlook is cloudy, complicated by how long it takes the housing market to recover from its deepest slump since the Great Depression.

U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd on Monday said he wants to bring Paulson before the committee this week to explain the takeover. Dodd predicted further trouble for the economy if the takeover kills Fannie and Freddie. Acknowledging that some critics for years have wanted to shut down Fannie and Freddie, Dodd said, "If this is an ideological thrust to make it impossible for these institutions to exist, then further economic deterioration is predictable." At least one thing is certain, as Dodd said: "A President Obama or a President McCain is going to have a mess dumped in their lap in the next 60 days." RANGE OF REFORMS Reform scenarios for Fannie and Freddie have been debated for years, ranging from nationalization at one extreme, to privatization at the other, with intermediate solutions in between like the middle ground the GSEs occupied until Sunday.
