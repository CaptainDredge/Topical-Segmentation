Bear's borrowing totaled $12.9 billion over the period of that credit facility, which the Fed arranged with JPMorgan last week to help rescue the ailing investment bank. Together, total discount window borrowing came to $19.05 billion a day in the latest week, the data showed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Lehman Brothers LEH.N said they were tapping the discount window to borrow money directly from the Fed this week.

"It looks like dealers made a reasonable first draw. That is a good start," said Carl Kaufman, portfolio manager for fixed income with Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco. "I think the facility is doing its job," Kaufman said. "In normal markets this would be a very large number, but now $29 billion for the entire dealer community does not seem to be a large number," he said.

Under normal market conditions that would be viewed as an extraordinarily high figure. But analysts said they wouldn't be surprised to see the number grow as dealers seek more financing directly from the Fed to shore up balance sheets depleted by the credit market crisis. The Fed data also showed that Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N received an average of $5.53 billion a day over the period of the credit facility arranged for it by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ).
