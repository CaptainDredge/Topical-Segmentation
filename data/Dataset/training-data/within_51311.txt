"This is a very limited area of expertise," plaintiffs lawyer Mark Robinson said during a two-hour hearing that dealt mostly with procedural issues. "Most of these are people who have worked for other companies." U.S. District Judge James Selna agreed, saying he saw no reason why former employees of other car companies could not be made privy to confidential material as experts for the plaintiffs without exposing Toyota's trade secrets.

Toyota ( 7203.T ) sought the exclusion as part of a protective order the judge will issue sealing from the public record any proprietary information that may compromise Toyota's competitive position during the so-called discovery process. Plaintiff's lawyers argued Toyota's request would have gone too far, hampering their ability to hire top-rate automobile industry engineers and other experts as they pursue scores of personal-injury and consumer class-action claims against the Japanese carmaker.

But many of the lawsuits suggest that at least some of the problems with surging engines are rooted in an as-yet unidentified glitch in Toyota's electronic throttle control system, which the company has steadfastly denied. Wednesday's hearing marked the second time the two sides have squared off in court since more than 100 separate federal lawsuits related to unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles were merged in April for pretrial proceedings and assigned to Judge Selna in Orange County, California.

The deadline is July 2. Those documents and many more to be turned over during discovery -- in which the two sides exchange information to prepare for trial -- will all be subject to the protective order argued in court on Wednesday. Such an order essentially will let Toyota decide which documents and other material will be labeled as confidential -- trade secrets such as product research and design or proprietary financial and marketing information.

Those records would then be turned over to the plaintiffs but be sealed from scrutiny except by officers of the court, lawyers and their respective clerks, paralegals and other employees. Under the judge's decision, plaintiffs' consultants, even if formerly employed by Toyota's rivals, also would be privy to the documents. Selna rebuffed Toyota's request to prohibit the most sensitive of its internal documents -- those it deems "highly confidential" -- from being shared between lawyers in the consolidated federal litigation and attorneys pursuing separate cases against Toyota in various state courts.
