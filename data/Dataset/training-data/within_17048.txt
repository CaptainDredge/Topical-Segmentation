OPEC meets in Vienna on March 5 under pressure from consumer nations to hike output to help tame prices. Venezuela cut commercial ties to Exxon after it won court orders freezing up to $12 billion in Venezuela's assets. Silva Calderon, a special envoy of President Hugo Chavez, also met Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, APS reported.

Exxon is claiming compensation for Venezuela's takeover of the Cerro Negro heavy crude project as part of Chavez's nationalization crusade meant to advance his self-styled socialist revolution. Chavez told foreign oil companies last year to cede a majority stake in oil projects or leave the country. Most agreed and accepted bids for stakes in their projects from state oil company PDVSA that analysts said were below market value.
