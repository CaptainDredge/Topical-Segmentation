Shares of JPMorgan Chase, up 11 percent and Bank of America, up nearly 7 percent, ranked among the top gainers in both the Dow and the S&P 500. An S&P index of financial shares rose 3.2 percent.

Apple's decline also hurt the Nasdaq. The government's bailout plan has run into stiff resistance on Capitol Hill, mostly from Republican lawmakers who have proposed an alternative that provides for no government money up front.

President George W. Bush said Congress would eventually agree on a plan, but investors said the market remained nervous about the outlook for corporate earnings and the health of the broader U.S. economy. "The plan is crucial to keeping the economy afloat, but it isn't going to turn around the housing crisis or pump new life into the economy," Dickson said.
