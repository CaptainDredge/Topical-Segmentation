Its second report published last week blamed weak supervision and poor control systems for the trading scandal. It painted a climate in which managers turned a blind eye to risks. SocGen did not discover Kerviel's unauthorized trades until January 18, even though the bank's internal reports showed that Kerviel had in 2007 raised alarms with derivatives exchange Eurex and been the subject of more than 70 "alert" warnings.

The losses from the Kerviel scandal made SocGen vulnerable to a takeover bid from rivals such as BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and forced the bank to raise 5.5 billion euros in capital to shore up its finances, also weakened by subprime losses. BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, ultimately ruled out a bid, at least for now.

"Who do you take us for?" said private shareholder Jean Richard, to rounds of applause followed by boos for Chairman Daniel Bouton, who stared sternly ahead from the podium. "You're guilty of having turned the bank into a casino," said another private investor, who did not give his name. Bouton responded that "the bank is not a casino," and brought out slide presentations to show that over an eight-year period, SocGen shares had remained among the best in the sector.

On Jan 24, SocGen unveiled 4.9 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of losses which it said were caused by deals made by Kerviel. The size of the losses eclipsed those of previous trading scandals, such as Nick Leeson's rogue trades which toppled the venerable British merchant bank Barings in 1995. SocGen said on Friday that Kerviel may have been helped by an assistant, but added there was no conclusive proof of this.

Shareholders also gave a rough ride to SocGen's accountants, Ernst & Young and Deloitte. They booed yet again as a representative told the meeting that he had studied the accounts and found "no anomalies." Around 1,500 people were present at the meeting, held near SocGen's headquarters in the Defense business district of Paris.
