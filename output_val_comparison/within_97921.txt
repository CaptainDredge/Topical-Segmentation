The EU is currently pursuing deals with the United States and Japan too. The U S deal championed by Cameron seeks to go far beyond tariff cuts and make it much easier for European and U S firms to do business in each other s markets. The size of the British economy is still to be reckoned with in the world economy but of course its share is rapidly shrinking and that means the willingness of other countries to prioritize the UK ahead of others is probably going to shrink said Fredrik Erixon who heads the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels.

HAGGLING OVER QUOTAS Petros Mavroidis a WTO expert at Columbia University said there would be no need to renegotiate Britain s membership of the global trade body since both it and the EU are already members. But that would depend on Britain not trying to take any of its rights to EU agricultural subsidies and quotas with it. 
********
If the UK wishes to pay subsidies then the EU and the UK will have to present a new proposal to all WTO members the sum of which will not exceed what they have already committed Mavroidis said.

Apportioning the right to agricultural subsidies would be made easier by the fact that the EU is using only a fraction of the agreed limit imposed by the WTO 8 76 billion euros of the 72 2 billion euro ceiling in 2009 2010.

Cameron has pledged an in out referendum in 2017 and opinion polls suggest the public is inclined towards the exit which would leave Britain in need of a deal to ensure exports to the EU are not hit with EU import tariffs which averaged 5 3 percent in 2011 and 13 9 percent in agriculture.

With no say in EU decisions Britain would also lose its right to defend against policies such as the European Central Bank s effort to bring clearing houses of euro denominated securities onto euro zone territory Erixon said. It s going to force a lot of financial activity to move outside London and inside the euro zone said Erixon
