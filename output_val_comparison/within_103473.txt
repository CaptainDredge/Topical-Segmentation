Moreover the Committee had some concern that the rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months would have the effect of slowing growth a concern that would be exacerbated if conditions tightened further. BERNANKE ON CONDITIONS FOR TAPERING At the meeting concluded earlier today the sense of the Committee was that the broad contours of the medium term economic outlook including economic growth sufficient to support ongoing gains in the labor market and inflation moving towards its objective were close to the views it held in June.

I think once the crisis got going it was extremely hard to prevent. I think we did what we could given the powers that we had and I would agree with Hank Paulson that we were motivated entirely by the interest of the broader public that our goal was to stabilize the financial system so that it would not bring the economy down so that it would not create massive unemployment and economic hardship that.

And so if these actions led the economy to slow then we would have to take that into account surely. So this is one of the risks that we are looking at as we think about policy. That being said you know again our ability to offset these shocks is very limited particularly a debt limit shock and I think it s extraordinarily important that Congress and the administration work together to find a way to make sure that the government is funded public services are provided that the government pays its bills and that we avoid any kind of event like 2011 which had at least for a time a noticeable adverse effect on confidence on the economy. BERNANKE ON BEING OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ON GROWTH We have been over optimistic about growth.

It appears again that the potential rate of growth of the economy has been slowed somewhat at least temporarily by the by the recession and the financial crisis and you can see that in the slower productivity figures. Now we haven t anticipated that slowdown in productivity and that s one of the reasons we haven t anticipated the relatively slow growth.

It was an intention the intention is to wait a bit longer and to try to get confirming evidence to whether or not the economy is in fact conforming to this general outlook that we have. BERNANKE ON FED COMMUNICATION AND FINANCIAL TIGHTENING As of June we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions and the Committee thought that was the time to begin talking about how the eventual wind down of the program would take place and how it would be tied to the evolution of economic variables. All of that was very consistent with what we said when we began the program that our goal was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and we needed to communicate how that was going to be put into practice
