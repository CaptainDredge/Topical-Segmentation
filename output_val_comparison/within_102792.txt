DETROIT Reuters Volkswagen AG and the United Auto Workers said they are in talks about the U S union s bid to represent workers at the German carmaker s Tennessee plant which would be a milestone in the UAW s long running effort to organize foreign owned auto plants Volkswagen officials in a letter distributed to workers at the Chattanooga Tennessee plant on Thursday night and Friday morning shifts said worker representation at the plant can only be realized by joining with a U S trade union.

If Bob King can get his foot in the door at Chattanooga even if it s just a works council it s pretty significant a former auto executive at a foreign automaker with U S plants who wished to remain anonymous said earlier this week. On Wednesday during a call about Volkswagen s U S sales Jonathan Browning head of the company in the United States said We ve been very clear that that process has to run its course that no management decision has been made and that it may or may not conclude with formal third party representation.

Browning also said that ultimately the decision on whether to have third party representation will be decided by Chattanooga s workers by a formal vote.

There was no indication in the letter to workers when such a vote would be held. The UAW also confirmed that King met last Friday with VW executives and officials from the company s global works council which represents VW blue and white collar employees around the world.

The UAW said last week s meeting focused on the appropriate paths consistent with American law for arriving at both Volkswagen recognition of UAW representation at its Chattanooga facility and establishment of a German style works council. At VW plants workers are represented by so called works councils which include laborers as well as executives who cooperate to determine issues ranging from company strategy to job conditions.

King is open to what Fischer called an innovative model in order to gain acceptance by workers at foreign owned auto plants which are primarily in the U S South. VW workers in Chattanooga have the unique opportunity to introduce this new model of labor relations to the United States in partnership with the UAW the UAW said in a statement on Friday morning.

UAW President Bob King has been trying without success thus far to organize foreign owned U S based auto plants to bolster membership in the union which has fallen from its peak in the late 1970s. The UAW has been working with the German union IG Metall to try to organize workers at the Volkswagen plant
