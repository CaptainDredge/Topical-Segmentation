The key issue is this delicate dance that needs to be done with the offshore territories and also with the G8 members said Robert Palmer at Global Witness. Some campaigners said Cameron should be applauded for raising the tax issue with leaders such as U S President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

There will be an agreement to look at the issue but that s probably about the best they will get said Bob Rothenberg a senior partner at London accountants Blick Rothenberg. That s a nice general thing but it means nothing.

But skeptics doubt the effectiveness of such unilateral steps unless the kind of opaque tax structures used by Britain s offshore territories are tackled head on. We also need a major crackdown on tax havens the bedrock of global tax avoidance Margaret Hodge Labour chairman of the British parliament s influential Public Accounts Committee PAC wrote in the Guardian this month.
