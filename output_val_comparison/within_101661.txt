A CBS spokeswoman later responded that Time Warner Cable had given the broadcaster an ultimatum. Time Warner Cable either does not want CBS doing deals in the digital space with companies like Netflix or it wants to take all of CBS online content for free CBS said. A Time Warner Cable spokesman then added that the cable company is willing to pay more for the same rights it had in a previous agreement and that CBS is countering by taking some of those rights away and charging more and we don t think it s right for customers to pay more while getting less. The debate around online content comes while cable operators are facing challenges from competitors such as Netflix that are making inroads with viewers who can pay less to watch shows online instead of paying for cable subscriptions.

The numbers aren t huge but they are statistically significant said Moffett Research analyst Craig Moffett in a research note. Moffett estimates that about 898 000 U S households have cut the cord in the past 12 months up from 455 000 households the previous year.

Martin added that CBS is not going to become Time Warner Cable s accomplice in trying to throttle those new services referring to companies such as Netflix and Amazon.

A spokesman said that its expired and proposed agreements with CBS place no restriction on their ability to sell all of their product to Netflix Amazon Intel or any other entity.
