In the run up to Wednesday s meeting the ABA task force submitted a draft proposal recommending streamlining the financial loss table while giving judges an ability to score a defendant s culpability a factor they say is generally overshadowed. Any changes could take years to fulfill. In the meantime judges have increasingly deviated from the guidelines which became advisory rather than mandatory after a U S Supreme Court decision in 2005.

While he said the pipeline scheme was treated as sophisticated Underhill wrote that it could be more accurately described as a comedic plot outline for a Three Stooges episode. It took just a Google search for a broker to figure out the deal smelled according to Underhill and no money was ever lost in what amounted to a case of absurd lies piled on top of even more absurd lies.

They also acknowledge that the prospect of reducing sentences for white collar defendants could run into opposition amid continued criticism of whether enough executives were held accountable for the recent financial downturn.

In a speech in March Rakoff called for the guidelines to be scrapped in their entirety saying the amount of the loss does not fairly convey the reality of the crime or the criminal. Rakoff who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton is a member of an American Bar Association task force arguing for a revision to the guidelines
