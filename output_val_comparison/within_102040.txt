The decision on one of the world s most closely watched military tenders will be made by a committee chaired by South Korea s defense minister after DAPA submits its final evaluation of the three fighters next month. DAPA will score the bids on a fixed set of criteria although Korean law prevents the government from signing a contract that exceeds the allotted budget.

It said the South Korean competition had multiple phases. One industry source said that the capabilities of the new fighters rather than cost would be a key factor in Seoul s decision. It s not going to be decided on cost alone said the source who is not authorized to speak publicly adding that the cost of the aircraft represents only 15 percent of the decision making process.

The sources also said that the Lockheed Martin bid was over budget though the company responded on Sunday by saying that it had not received any official notification regarding the latest bidding results. Lockheed said reports that it had been eliminated from the competition were not accurate and it continued to work with the U S government on its offer of the F 35 fighter for South Korea.

The sources close to the process said this was the bid submitted by the Eurofighter consortium in which EADS EAD PA is an investor. EADS maintains that the Eurofighter remains in the race. We are open for any constructive discussion with DAPA Christian Scherer head of sales and international operations at EADS Cassidian said in a statement on Monday.
