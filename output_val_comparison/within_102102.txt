The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual. The staff s forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the January FOMC meet ing.

The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually.

In addition although the staff did not change its view of the longer run level of the natural rate of unemployment it judged that the natural rate was on a more pronounced downward trajectory back toward its longer run level than previously assumed as a result the staff s projection for the unemployment rate over the next two years was revised down a little relative to its previous forecast.

However the staff s medium term projection for real GDP was revised up somewhat. The staff raised its projected paths for equity and home prices which pushed up expected consumer spending over the medium term and boosted its outlook for domestic oil production which reduced oil imports in the forecast.

These positive factors were partly offset in the staff s medium term GDP projection by higher projected paths for both longer term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

The staff viewed the uncertainty around its forecast for economic activity as similar to the average level over the past 20 years.

Although the staff saw the outlook for inflation as uncertain the risks were viewed as balanced and not unusually high.

The staff continued to see numerous risks around the forecast. Among the downside risks for economic activity were the uncertain effects and future course of fiscal policy the possibility of adverse developments in foreign economies and concerns about the ability of the U S economy to weather potential future adverse shocks. The most salient risk for the inflation outlook was that the recent softness in inflation would not abate as anticipated
