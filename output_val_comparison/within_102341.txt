Virgin has been trying to take market share in that domestic space so Qantas has sort of retaliated and tried to hold their ground said Nathan Zaia an analyst at Morningstar in Sydney adding capacity is currently well above demand. Both airlines had also done well out of fly in fly out contracts from mining companies and from scheduled services to regional destinations and smaller towns within Australia.

Virgin Australia blamed the loss on a difficult business environment higher costs including a new ticketing system and new carbon tax and losses from the Skywest acquisition. QANTAS FARES BETTER Qantas which reports on Thursday is forecast to report a full year pre tax profit of A 92 7 million and after tax profit of A66 4 million on Thursday according to ThomsonReuters data.

That is slowing down in tandem with the mining sector added Akshay Chopra an analyst at Karara Capital in Melbourne. A lot of those customers have been very profitable because they ve been paying big prices on tickets to fly these regional and sub regional areas. As some of those slow that s clearly going to have an impact Chopra said.

It appears to be faring better by virtue of having the lion s share of the domestic market while its subsidiary Jetstar dominates the low cost segment. Qantas has also reduced losses in its international business by retiring older aircraft and by forming a partnership with Emirates EMIRA UL on services to Europe. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce told Reuters in August that his airline was still winning some mining contracts despite the slowdown.

He forecast that there would be some reduction in domestic capacity helping to increase profitability. Australia he added had gone through these cycles before. Zaia agreed saying I am expecting capacity growth to be slow or just flat. As we get population growth and business confidence and consumer confidence increases that demand will pick up. The falling Australian dollar which is likely to increase fuel costs is also a concern
