A portfolio manager that specializes in mortgage credit and who spoke on the condition of anonymity questioned Ackman s decision to make such a large bet on Fannie and Freddie calling the common shares and preferred shares worthless. He said a plan to privatize the two companies will never fly in Congress. He added that the government s credit guarantee has been the reason for the profits as it was for the losses. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been operating under government conservatorship since the fall of 2008 and the 2012 changes of the bailout terms mean the two pay nearly all of their profits to the federal government in the form of dividends.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency which oversees Fannie and Freddie declined to comment Friday on the Pershing Square investments. In a statement Friday a Treasury official said The administration remains committed to reforming the housing finance sector by responsibly winding down Fannie and Freddie and ensuring that any new system preserves broad access to credit for responsible borrowers strengthens the economy and promotes financial stability. Any effort to recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which were seized by the U S government during the 2008 housing crisis would require congressional approval
