At the same time measures of economic output are pointing to much more lackluster growth. The economy expanded at a 1 8 percent annual rate in the first quarter and many economists think a wave of federal budget cuts could slow growth to roughly half that pace in the April June period.

Prices for U S stocks and government debt rose a day after comments by U S Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated the central bank was unlikely to scale back its stimulus measures earlier than expected.
